28/12/23, 3:00 PM - +260 97 9935858: This was your guide 👆🏾
28/12/23, 3:01 PM - +260 97 9935858: Check last paragraph
28/12/23, 3:02 PM - +260 97 9935858: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - +260 97 9935858: This is a serious inconvenience on my part. Our currency keeps on fluctuating.. Today it's higher than 2 days ago when we had made payments. Why didn't you respond immediately?
28/12/23, 3:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, and indeed, the fluctuating economy of Zambia can lead to variations in the exchange rate. I appreciate your perspective, and I wanted to share the update for the remaining $12 with you earlier. However, as we received the exact amount from the accounts team after you had already made the payment, I am reaching out to you at my earliest to provide this information, especially given the proximity of the due date set by the university.
28/12/23, 3:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, the only remaining balance for the Mphatso's university registration fee is $12. I would like to understand when you plan to make this deposit. Additionally, could you let me know if you intend to pay the fee through Penmal Connect or Bank Transfer? 

This information will enable us to update the university and assist you in clearing your dues before the application deadline on December 31, 2023.
28/12/23, 3:19 PM - +260 97 9935858: You initially shared this?
Check the difference then you will understand my concerns. Why didn't you deduct the 5% earlier?
You misled us and now you want us to bear the consequences. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:22 PM - +260 97 9935858: Inform your financial team that it's not our fault that we underpaid but yours. I'm so sorry to say this but it's like you just share information without verifying if it's correct. How else do you expect me to have confidence in all steps that we have to take in this whole program. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:24 PM - +260 97 9935858: Money matters are delicate and sensitive. I don't want to preempt anything but this is a great inconvenience on part. I made frantic efforts to ensure that I meet the agreed deadline and now this 🤷🏽‍♀️
28/12/23, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ma'am, itis important to clarify that no one has misled you. The difference in the amount occurred due to fluctuating exchange rates. If you wish to verify this, you can directly confirm with our associate in Zimbabwe, through whom you made the payment. Please understand that the variance is a result of transfer charges imposed by the associated banks, beyond our control.
28/12/23, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the light of the same, I emphasize our commitment to communication. Despite the physical distance between us, our priority is to provide clarification rather than assigning blame in case of any misunderstandings.

Additionally, it's important to note that the fee you are currently paying is a part of your child's university fee and not a payment to the accounts team.
28/12/23, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We recognize the importance of financial planning in education, and we aim to ensure that your child's application remains on track. These updates have been shared with you for transparency and to keep you informed. We understand that the perception of this update may vary, and we acknowledge that we cannot control how it is perceived and hence I am not sure what you want us to say here, but yes, as your admisison officer, I am open to any further clarification or discussion you may require in this regard.
28/12/23, 3:35 PM - +260 97 9935858: I'm failing to understand this. You mean you only received the payment made in November now?
28/12/23, 3:37 PM - +260 97 4172165: But you informed us that the remaining balance is $267.
28/12/23, 3:38 PM - +260 97 9935858: But I still need correct figures to help plan. It's hard to fix things when you are just caught unaware like this. Why were the 5% deductions not shared earlier? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:38 PM - +260 97 9935858: Exactly
28/12/23, 3:40 PM - +260 97 9935858: Name of Student: Mphatso Fumbani Lengwe

International Transfer Charges: $28 (*5% Along with that +1 Kwacha on the Exchange Rate of the Day* of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $550 + $28 = $578 +1 Kwacha on the Exchange Rate of the Day

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $128 + $155 (Paid on 28 and 30 November 2023)

28/12/23, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your perspective, and I want to clarify a point regarding our recent communications. Upon reviewing the messages, there was indeed a clerical error on our end. The amount you paid is from $550, whereas it has to be $578. This discrepancy was an oversight from our side, and it seems it wasn't noticed by you as well. The reason we share the breakdown with you as parents is to avoid these errors. I want to assure you that there's no intention to assign blame here; our focus is on finding a constructive way forward.
28/12/23, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We have supported you in the past and continue to stand by you. What we need now is to figure out how best to proceed. Could you please share your plans for making the remaining deposit of $12? Also, it would be helpful to know whether you plan to use Penmal Connect or a Bank Transfer for the payment.

This information is important for us to update the university appropriately and to help you clear your dues before the application deadline on December 31, 2023. Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated.

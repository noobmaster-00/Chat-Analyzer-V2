The second one is in form 3 doing sciences 
The third one is in grade 6 
Then the last one is an ECD
10/01/24, 4:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Brdiget, I hope your parents are aware that you have applied for the scholarship program that would lead you to study abroad? And are they willing to support you financially in your higher education abroad?
10/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 341 4264: They are aware of that but supporting me financially is going to be hard because Zimbabwe is a hard Country and as it is right now they are struggling to send my other sisters to school hence l applied for a scholarship so that they that they are focusing on my other three sisters only relieving their stress for me
10/01/24, 4:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand bridget, but I would like to inform you that the scholarship is given on the tuition fee but apart from that there are other expenses may I know who and how will those expenses be catered?
10/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I will be working part time while l will be studying and the little that is left my parents will help
10/01/24, 4:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, But may I know when your parents financially started to plan for your higher education abroad?
10/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Last year
10/01/24, 5:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, Bridget.

10/01/24, 5:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like you to take today's time and go through this document and discuss it with your parents as well.
10/01/24, 5:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 10 AM CAT.
Good night and god bless!
10/01/24, 9:25 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok Goodnight and God bless you too
11/01/24, 8:25 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263713414264 @263776332762 , Hope you are doing well.
11/01/24, 8:25 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
11/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we can start
11/01/24, 10:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please, may I know if you have gone through this document?
11/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l have gone through it
11/01/24, 10:04 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what all you have discussed?
11/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 71 341 4264: We have discussed mostly about the scholarship and came to a conclusion that you will have to see a my O level results and then come to a conclusion whether l deserve the fully funded scholarship 
During that l would be doing internship for my scholarship 
As a student who only wants to study in India we did not discuss abt going to other countries like USA and Canada
They really liked the idea of earn while you learn because as a person you will gain some skills and have a sharp mind and the fact that it won’t affect my studying time
11/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 341 4264: They really appreciate that EDOOFA will assist in the application of visas so that the application goes smoothly 
They also believe in all the aspects that EDOOFA believes in so you have their full support on those ones
11/01/24, 10:24 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what exactly you mean by a fully funded scholarship?
11/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 341 4264: Whereby all the expenses are covered except for the travelling ones
11/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 71 341 4264: It’s the first question
11/01/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
11/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 341 4264: So how do you apply for sponsorship since that is what l want
11/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 341 4264: Can l still get sponsorship under EDOOFA and does EDOOFA offer sponsorships
11/01/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Bridget, as the name itself justifies The EDOOFA program is a scholarship program and not a sponsorship program.
11/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok if my scholarship application is approved l would like to move forward with it and about the other expenses my parents said they will assist me with them alongside me doing internship
11/01/24, 11:34 am - Garima Edoofa: I would really appreciate it if your father is concerned about your higher education abroad. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 11:36 am - Garima Edoofa: I see you are interested in pursuing Biomedical . Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
11/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 341 4264: My grandfather died of cancer there were no tablets that we could give so that he can be cured .....chemotherapy was very expensive to and we did not have money for that ....l don’t want someone else to suffer the same fate as my grandfather so l told myself that l would be a biomedical engineer and help discover cures for diseases that don’t have them
11/01/24, 12:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am so sorry for your loss. May I know from your family or known circle if anyone pursued a career in this field?
11/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Non that l know of have
11/01/24, 12:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Great, So now I would like you to share the picture with me of your previous qualification results i.e O and A-Level results
along with the subject combination in A-level and year of passing A-level

Along with that could you please tell what desire course you wish to study?
11/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I have O levels and am planning to write my A levels this year
11/01/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Could you please share your O-level result with me, along with the subject combination in A-level?
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 341 4264: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 341 4264: A level am doing sciences 
Maths, biology and chemistry
11/01/24, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Along with that could you please tell what desire course you wish to study?
11/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Biomedical engineering
11/01/24, 1:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have done some research regarding the same?
11/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l have
11/01/24, 1:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please, feel free to share the information.
11/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 341 4264: In order to become a biomedical engineer, you'll need a strong foundation in the sciences, especially biology, chemistry, and physics. You'll also need to be comfortable with math and computer science, as many biomedical engineering projects involve working with data and modeling. A background in engineering, especially electrical engineering or computer engineering, is also helpful. Ultimately, though, the most important thing is to have a passion for the field and a desire to help people through the use of technology.
11/01/24, 2:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well,
With your interest in the Biomedical Engineering field, may I know why you didn't opt for Physics for A level?
11/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Since it said biomedical which meant that there is biology and l could not do the two together
11/01/24, 6:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
11/01/24, 8:14 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Same to you too
11/01/24, 8:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to correct my above-shared message, we will not be connecting with you tomorrow but we will be connecting with you on Saturday. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 8:18 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok that is fine with me
13/01/24, 8:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263776332762 @263713414264 , Hope you are doing well.
13/01/24, 8:51 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
13/01/24, 8:56 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we are doing and you
13/01/24, 8:57 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we can start
13/01/24, 9:06 am - Garima Edoofa: I am doing good, please.
13/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
13/01/24, 9:15 am - Garima Edoofa: I would like to tell you that physics forms the backbone of engineering, providing the fundamental principles and laws that govern the behavior of the physical world. In engineering, a deep understanding of physics is crucial for designing, analyzing, and optimizing various systems and structures.

Mechanical engineers, for instance, leverage principles of classical mechanics to design machinery, analyze forces, and ensure structural integrity. Electrical engineers apply principles of electromagnetism and circuit theory to design electronic devices and systems. Civil engineers rely on physics to understand the properties of materials and the behavior of structures under different loads.

Furthermore, thermodynamics, a branch of physics, plays a vital role in fields like aerospace engineering and chemical engineering, where the study of heat transfer and energy transformation is essential.

In essence, physics provides the theoretical framework and mathematical tools that engineers use to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. A robust grasp of physics enhances an engineer's ability to predict and control the behavior of systems, contributing to the advancement of technology and the development of new applications.
13/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
13/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 71 341 4264: So l should have physics
13/01/24, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please send the picture your A-level results?
13/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 71 341 4264: I am writing this year
13/01/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, since you have not opted for physics May I know what other course interest you the most?
13/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 71 341 4264: Medicine
13/01/24, 11:15 am - Garima Edoofa: Well  as you mentioned it is your desire to study medicine, but, unfortunately, we don't offer medicine as a course for the following reasons:

1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive courses everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.
 
2. Eligibility: India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.
 
3. Length of the program: Medicine is a 6-8 years course including the internships(attachment) that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
 
But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses in Medical Field such as
 
1. Bachelor of Science in Nursing
2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology 
 
These courses have a lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
13/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 341 4264: What if l do physics will l be able to do biomedical engineering
13/01/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes if you have opted for physics in your A-level then only you are eligible to do biomedical engineering, please.
13/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok l will do physics then
13/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 341 4264: In the meantime l will choose bachelor in Physiotherapy
13/01/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *Monday again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
13/01/24, 7:39 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
13/01/24, 7:39 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Same to you
15/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 71 341 4264: Hello
15/01/24, 9:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263713414264 @263776332762 , Hope you are doing well.
15/01/24, 9:47 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
15/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 341 4264: I am doing well and u
15/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we can start
15/01/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you? if yes then shall I brief you about the course?
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I want a course that is highly marketable so can you please advise me on which one to take according to the subjects that l am doing
15/01/24, 2:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Considering your interest there are similar courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for such as
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

*Bachelor of Science in nutrition and dietetics*

Would you like me to explain these programs to you?
15/01/24, 2:11 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes please
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know which course shall I brief you?
15/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Bachelor of Science in Microbiology
15/01/24, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3-year long, full-time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.

If l get into EDOOFA’s program the achievement of what l have written above will only be possible because of that
16/01/24, 11:24 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Bridget

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
16/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l am willing to give it my all
16/01/24, 12:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Well as you that it’s better to work in a developed country than a developing country and for Zimbabwe is facing some economic problems which are making many people suffer
16/01/24, 2:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 341 4264: In Zimbabwe very few doctors are specialised so for my country someone like me with a career like mine it would be a very big advantage on its own because developing countries are usually affected by many diseases which some they don’t even know that cures are there
16/01/24, 2:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Bridget, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I do agree with you
16/01/24, 3:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
16/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l am wondering

19/01/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, As I was facing some urgent health challenges.

I am here to continue with our discussion, shall we start?
19/01/24, 7:10 pm - +263 71 341 4264: It’s l am facing electricity problems. Electricity has been gone for the past 3 days and it has not yet came back
19/01/24, 7:11 pm - +263 71 341 4264: It will give me a big exposure to other things and expects of life
19/01/24, 7:13 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Since the country has the best education  am aiming to achieve high things in life
20/01/24, 10:15 am - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, as I was facing some technical challenges, but now we shall continue.
20/01/24, 10:16 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Bridget. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
20/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 341 4264: It’s ok
20/01/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
20/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we are aware of that and unfortunately if l don’t have a scholarship l won’t be able to attend my higher education as an international student
20/01/24, 11:16 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand, please, let me help you have a better clarity for the same.
20/01/24, 11:16 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 11:16 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 11:16 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/01/24, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for your family?
20/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this message please.
20/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 71 341 4264: I did and l noticed that other European countries are very expensive compared to India
20/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 71 341 4264: Let me discuss with them
20/01/24, 11:20 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes , please.
20/01/24, 11:21 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Bridget what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
20/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes you can
20/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 71 341 4264: They said that per year they can afford it
20/01/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/01/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/01/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
20/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
20/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
20/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l think this will benefit me a lot
20/01/24, 11:43 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/01/24, 11:43 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 341 4264: It is what l have been looking for , for my tertiary education
20/01/24, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
20/01/24, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
20/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I appreciated all of them
20/01/24, 12:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Bridget, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
20/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes
20/01/24, 12:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Bridget, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l am
20/01/24, 12:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Bridget as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 71 341 4264: $1500 -$2250
20/01/24, 1:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/01/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/01/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 1:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
20/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok 
I will discuss about that with my parents
20/01/24, 1:07 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I do too
20/01/24, 1:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/01/24, 1:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Bridget basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/01/24, 1:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 1:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Bridget, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
20/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 341 4264: That l have to pay $200 for application in 7 days and the other $150 in 30 days
20/01/24, 1:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
20/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Bridegt and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
20/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l have understood and l am going to discuss with my parents all this
20/01/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, I would really appreciate that.
20/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 1:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/01/24, 1:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 1:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
20/01/24, 1:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 341 4264: For me to move from step 1 l have to pay ❓
20/01/24, 1:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this message please.
20/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok l now understand
20/01/24, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
20/01/24, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/01/24, 1:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 1:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
20/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 71 341 4264: So about the application to universities do you choose for me or l choose for my self the universities that l want to apply to
20/01/24, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Once you are done with the counseling session and done with the enrollment process, later when your admission process starts the admission officer will guide you through all your concern.
20/01/24, 2:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
20/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes
20/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
20/01/24, 2:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/01/24, 2:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

20/01/24, 2:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

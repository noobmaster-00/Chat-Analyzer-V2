18/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Thokozile and Mrs. Tshuma!

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Noah

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Hie
18/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Yes it's the right person
18/01/24, 3:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today,

You can address me as Mr. Keshav and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of Counseling, who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
18/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Thank you, will certainly adhere to what you are saying
18/01/24, 3:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Thokozile!
18/01/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 71 797 1883: Yes i do have what it takes to meet the standards needed
18/01/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is the spirit Thokozile!, Amazing

But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

19/01/24, 12:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: BSW, also termed as Bachelor of Social Work is a 3 year undergraduate degree course that provides knowledge and skills to work in the social sector, aiming to provide quality life as well as education. Social Work, as the name suggests, aims to provide each and every citizen, specifically the less priviledged ones, a dignified life worth living with all aspects of social amenities and equal justice.

*What is BSW Course*
BSW is a three-year undergraduate professional degree course majoring in the field of social work. A typical BSW degree course lasts three years and is broken down into six semesters.  In certain circumstances, candidates are required to finish the program within a maximum of six years. Candidates can enroll in BSW full-time or even as a correspondence or distance learning degree. There are three main components to the BSW course: the foundation course, the elective course, and the fieldwork.

BSW courses can be pursued in various colleges in the country. It is useful to candidates who may like to work in social welfare sectors as it helps them acquire professional skills and knowledge to help the clients deal with their emotional and psychological problems. The curriculum provides social work education and training based on indigenous knowledge. It helps the learner to develop the required attitudes in understanding people’s problem-solving interventions.

*Why Study BSW*
BSW is apt for candidates interested in providing professional assistance to people in need. 

-BSW is specially meant for the ones who are aiming at improving the quality of life of the poorest of the poor and understand the growing demand for professionally trained social workers across the country.

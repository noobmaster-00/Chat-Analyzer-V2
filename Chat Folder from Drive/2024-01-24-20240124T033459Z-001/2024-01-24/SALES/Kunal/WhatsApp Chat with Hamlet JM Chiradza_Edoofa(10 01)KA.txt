You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
10/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok my son Hamlet is a quiet guy he likes going to church.Spent most of his time reading.His wish is to study abroad he always says that.He passed his O level with 11 subjects A's and B's.At the moment he is doing his A level at Thekwane high school.His carrer aspirations he wants to be a doctor.He likes foot ball.He is the only son in the family others are girls.Thekwane is his school from form 1 to A level and he is now the deputy head boy at school.School fees we are paying $605 and $60 for science levie.The father is the one who is paying fees.
10/01/24, 2:40 pm - Kunal: It's wonderful to learn more about, Hamlet. His academic achievements with 11 subjects at O-level, his dedication to studies, and his position as the deputy head boy at Thekwane High School showcase his commitment to both education and leadership. His dream of studying abroad to become a doctor is ambitious and admirable, especially given his impressive academic performance.
10/01/24, 2:41 pm - Kunal: I hope you are aware that studying abroad involves a financial aspect. May I know who will support him financially with his education abroad?
10/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yes iam aware.The reason why he sent his application to you is he needs some financial help coz we as parents we can not afford.Fees we are struggling  the reason we want this boy to get somewhere in life.
10/01/24, 3:23 pm - Kunal: I can understand
As you know, Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible, are you in a position to raise them?
10/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok i think good to know the range of fees that way we can have an idea if we can afford.
10/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 114 2891: its good to know rang of fees
10/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Can i ask.What about the air tickets and visa's .
10/01/24, 3:46 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
10/01/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok i undertand
10/01/24, 4:50 pm - +263 77 114 2891: understand
10/01/24, 4:52 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Now what i want to know is how much fees just give me an idea since we are interested.

11/01/24, 2:17 pm - Kunal: Noted
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Hamlet achieving it. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok noted i as a parent iam expecting good results.By his grace he can make it.
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 114 2891: And i think 2 passes its fair
11/01/24, 2:36 pm - Kunal: May I know with with dream to be a doctor, why didn't he opt for Physics at A level?
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Umm that much i dont know.
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
11/01/24, 2:47 pm - Kunal: Since he is not having Physics, I regret to inform you that he is not eligible for Medicine, but considering his interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that he is eligible for and which can help fulfill his dreams of working in this field

This enables the degree holder to go for higher degree programs in respective subjects for a master’s degree and then further studies
11/01/24, 3:05 pm - Kunal: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.

17/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Thanx for sharing sir i have learnt a lot about India.All the information i have so far is good.What i know is once my son gets a chance to study in India he will get quality education and the opportunity of getting a job is wide since you said Indian degrees are globally recognized.
17/01/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
17/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yes yes he must work hard to achieve his goals.
17/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 114 2891: No iam not familia with the cost can you share with us
17/01/24, 12:47 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/01/24, 12:47 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 12:47 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
17/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok will go through
17/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Excuse me will connect after 30minutes
17/01/24, 1:08 pm - Kunal: Alright Please
Let me know once you are back
17/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Iam back
17/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 114 2891: For my self if my son gets a scholarship which is less than $3000 per year as parents we can afford.
17/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Your fees are affordable if compared to other countries.
17/01/24, 1:53 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/01/24, 1:53 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/01/24, 1:53 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok ok i understand.Can I ask if my child joins EWYL programme do we still pay fees or the salary will be enough to pay the remaining fees after the scholarship.
17/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Its a good adea it make life easy
17/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 114 2891: makes life easy
17/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Is their salaries enough for them to survive without help from parents.
17/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
17/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:20 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that the scholarship credits earned from the EWYL program will contribute in reducing the cost of education
But as parents you will be helping the student in the cost of Living and Transportation and basic needs
17/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ook i understand yaa true the costs will be reduced i see.
17/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 114 2891: So how do they do studing and working at the same time.
17/01/24, 2:33 pm - Kunal: It's important to note that the work component in programs like this is typically structured to be manageable, so it doesn't overwhelm students or interfere with their studies. Additionally, Edoofa is committed to providing the necessary support and guidance to ensure that students can successfully balance work and academics.
However, I'd like to emphasize that the "Earn While You Learn" program, is designed to strike a balance between work and study, ultimately benefiting the student in several ways
17/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok thank you i understand
17/01/24, 2:35 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
17/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Number 4
17/01/24, 2:43 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

However may I know, who will be helping Hamlet with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program? <This message was edited>
17/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Kkk not Thomas its Hamlet
17/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 114 2891: His father
17/01/24, 2:48 pm - Kunal: Excuse me for the typing error
I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
17/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 114 2891: I feel happy and proud he will be the first one in the family to study abroad and get quality education.
17/01/24, 2:56 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
17/01/24, 2:56 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
17/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yes true
17/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok noted
17/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Other requirements i dont know
17/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 114 2891: You provide the Application form right.
17/01/24, 3:12 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/01/24, 3:12 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yes go ahead
17/01/24, 3:19 pm - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
17/01/24, 3:19 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
17/01/24, 3:19 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
17/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok i understand so you said will pay the $350 after completing the Application form and a letter of recommendation from the head.
17/01/24, 3:28 pm - Kunal: No dear
You will have to pay the enrollment fee only if you are found eligible for the program and receives an acceptance letter from the Board
17/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Ok its fine
17/01/24, 3:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yaa its a long process kkkk you will guide us through out the way.
17/01/24, 3:31 pm - Kunal: Please go through this image and tell me upto which stage have we discussed so far.
17/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 114 2891: This message was deleted
17/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 114 2891: I think we have disscused everything on that chat
17/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Except number 6
17/01/24, 3:36 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yaa explain everything
17/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 114 2891: So its a long way to go
17/01/24, 3:40 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
17/01/24, 3:40 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
17/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 114 2891: Yes everything is clear
17/01/24, 3:51 pm - Kunal: Alright please
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
17/01/24, 3:52 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

18/01/24, 3:27 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>

19/01/24, 8:30 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning Everyone
19/01/24, 8:30 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you all are doing well?
19/01/24, 8:31 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I wanted to ask, so far from the entire discussion would you like to ask anything please?
19/01/24, 8:34 am - +263 77 114 2891: Good morning
19/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 677 4552: My wife has shared all that has been discussed so far.  Perhaps my question is on the " You earn while you learn" initiative. It is compulsory or is it optional . It is a good initiative but it will take up some of the study time in terms of the working time and resting time after work. I however concede that it helps in lessening the fees burden.
19/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 677 4552: Is it compulsory....***👆
19/01/24, 9:56 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263776774552 it is an opportunity that is provided to every Edoofian, however realizing the opportunity is something that is entire based on student's hard work. While for overall career growth the program is a must, there are cases where students opt for flexible participation based on their timetable in the University. So all in all it is not a compulsory program.
19/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 677 4552: Ok
19/01/24, 10:20 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Anything else you would like to ask @263776774552?
19/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 677 4552: Am afraid not at the moment. But if anything comes to mind l will ask
19/01/24, 10:56 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright @263776774552 so now I would like to ask you a few question, are you ready?
19/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 677 4552: Please go ahead
19/01/24, 12:24 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>

20/01/24, 7:27 am - +263 77 677 4552: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 9:38 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning @263776774552, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/01/24, 9:39 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I do understand the same, you see, during my stay in Zimbabwe from March to June 2023, I gained valuable insights. Many Zimbabwean students, including those I interacted with and those who shared their experiences, highlighted the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $3000-$4000 annually.

While the cost of education remains within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.

During my visit, I encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, they shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I understand the harsh realities they face.

Here are a few pictures of my interactions with students and their parents during my time there
20/01/24, 9:39 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 9:39 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 9:39 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Now surely as a parent this might be the last thing you would want for your child, because of which you are tremendously working hard. However since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. *The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.*

2. *On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.* 

Or 

*A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.*

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/01/24, 9:39 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
20/01/24, 9:39 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th January 2024 for $200 and the 27th or 28th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th January 2024.

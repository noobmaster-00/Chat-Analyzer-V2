I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
19/01/24, 10:42 am - +260 97 3642584: Edoofa is a scholarship program that is Merit based, this means that they range from distinctions to Merits in terms of acceptance at the universities where your applications will be sent to. It's not a sponsorship based program but a scholarship based program.
19/01/24, 11:06 am - +260 97 3642584: it is a 50% scholarship program , with good benefits provided by it through the Earn While You Learn program (ewyl).
19/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
19/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/01/24, 1:11 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir
19/01/24, 1:11 pm - +260 97 3642584: It is
19/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Chisomo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 2:50 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir I have what it takes
19/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Now Chisomo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

22/01/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Chisomo, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of science in Optometry
22/01/24, 1:54 pm - +260 97 3642584: Okay sir
22/01/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, if you want to go ahead with any of these given courses?
22/01/24, 2:11 pm - +260 97 3642584: May I perhaps change to any other course apart from the ones above
22/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what do you want to do?
22/01/24, 2:26 pm - +260 97 3642584: Okay sir I will go ahead with Bachelor of science in medical Laboratory Technology
22/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.

22/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
22/01/24, 2:31 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir
22/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
22/01/24, 2:36 pm - +260 97 3642584: Thank you sir
22/01/24, 2:37 pm - +260 97 3642584: Is there a Degree program for this course sir
22/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Please, this is the degree program.
22/01/24, 2:52 pm - +260 97 3642584: Okay sir thank you
22/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the program?
22/01/24, 2:56 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes I have sir
22/01/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/01/24, 3:36 pm - +260 97 3642584: If am provided with this career pathway I would work hard to help sick people, help the health sector . Like in a case of Zambia we are currently facing a cholera outbreak where a lot of laboratory work is needed to test different samples inorder to find the cure and cause of cholera.So if the outbreak will ever come in the future when I have completed my course .I would fully take part in the fight of the diseases.I see my self working very hard to combat diseases and to help the world to be a better place to live in.The Edoofa program would really help me achieve my dreams by providing me with quality education and good learning skills cause I know India is one of the best countries with the best  university in the world, and I would not like to miss such an opportunity .
22/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Chisomo I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
22/01/24, 3:38 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes am very willing sir
22/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/01/24, 3:43 pm - +260 97 3642584: Because I want to aquire quality education and the best education in the best Indian university. Which my country and it's university can not provide.
22/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/01/24, 3:50 pm - +260 97 3642584: I would help the education system of my country by adding on to the knowledge they already have and teaching them of what they don't know which is taught abroad
22/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Chisomo, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 3:55 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes I agree
22/01/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/01/24, 3:57 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes it is
22/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
22/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

23/01/24, 12:09 am - +260 97 3642584: Good day to you too sir
23/01/24, 8:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/01/24, 9:58 am - +260 97 3642584: Okay sir
23/01/24, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: So now Chisomo, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/01/24, 10:22 am - +260 97 3642584: I have a question
23/01/24, 10:25 am - +260 97 3642584: So if a student qualifies does Edoofa provide transportation and accomodations for them or maybe the student has to provide for themselves
23/01/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Please, the cost of travelling to India is a one time cost that you have to bear, but I assure you our VISA experts will be there to guide to you through the whole process.
23/01/24, 11:36 am - +260 97 3642584: Okay thank you
23/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/01/24, 12:11 pm - +260 97 3642584: No we are not
23/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/01/24, 1:05 pm - +260 97 3642584: That is very nice
23/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/01/24, 1:40 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir go ahead
23/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Chisomo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/01/24, 2:00 pm - +260 97 3642584: It's a Very nice program
23/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

23/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/01/24, 2:20 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes it will really benefit me
23/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Chisomo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/01/24, 2:37 pm - +260 97 3642584: Okay
23/01/24, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/01/24, 3:27 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes it is
23/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Chisomo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/01/24, 3:29 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir
23/01/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 97 3642584: No not yet sir
23/01/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 3:39 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir
23/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Chisomo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 3:48 pm - +260 97 3642584: About $1,500-$2,250 sir
23/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Chisomo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 4:01 pm - +260 97 3642584: Okay sir
23/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 4:02 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes it is sir
23/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/01/24, 4:15 pm - +260 97 3642584: Okay sir
23/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/01/24, 4:18 pm - +260 97 3642584: No am not
23/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Chisomo, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
23/01/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/01/24, 4:25 pm - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir
23/01/24, 4:30 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/01/24, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/01/24, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/01/24, 4:43 pm - +260 97 3642584: No questions sir
23/01/24, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/01/24, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/01/24, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
23/01/24, 5:33 pm - +260 97 3642584: Okay sir

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Thank you
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prayer,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Thank you all the best in your future endevours
8/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Thank you very much looking forward for your guidance
8/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 352 7223: You are talking to Prayer l lost my phone and currently using my mothers phone
9/1/24, 8:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear. I am happy to be here to support you.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 6:22 PM - +263 77 352 7223: So far l have no changes but if l have any l will surely notify you
9/1/24, 6:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's absolutely fine not to set any New Year's resolutions; concentrating on refining your current situation can be equally impactful and worthwhile.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 77 352 7223: I think this is the right time now.Last time i was at a boarding school and i  was concentrating with my examinations.Now iam available.
9/1/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Prayer. I would like to schedule a session for tomorrow at 8:00 AM to discuss the further application process in detail. Does that work for you?
10/1/24, 8:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear. How are you today?
10/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Prayer lost her phone 2 days ago she was using mine to communicate with you.As from tomorrow she will be having her own phone.
11/1/24, 8:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning. Thank you for sharing this information with me. May I know if she is available today to continue with our discussion regarding her admission procedure?
16/1/24, 8:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prayer,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 78 694 4518: How are you doing
17/1/24, 9:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prayer.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 9:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, dear. Thank you for asking. I hope you are doing well too. Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Okay thank you

22/1/24, 11:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parent and Prayer
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *11:30 am CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 5:09 AM - +263 78 694 4518: How are you
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parent and Prayer
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 694 4518: Yes
23/1/24, 11:59 AM - Austin Edoofa: It is good to hear from you, Prayer!

23/1/24, 11:59 AM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:01 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on your excellent A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session?
23/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Thank you so much
23/1/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome! Prayer
23/1/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 12:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 694 4518: We have discussed to continue with edoofa
23/1/24, 12:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Prayer!
23/1/24, 12:41 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Umm that's nice
23/1/24, 12:41 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Let me share with you that all students who are in India have gone through what you might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*
23/1/24, 12:43 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 694 4518: No
23/1/24, 12:44 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 694 4518: Let me go through
23/1/24, 12:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure Prayer!
23/1/24, 1:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Prayer, have you gone through?

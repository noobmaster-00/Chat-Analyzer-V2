12/1/24, 5:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Lesley,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 5:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 5:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 11:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 2:25 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day, dear parent and Lesley, 
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
22/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 78 990 3247: Good day to you too
22/1/24, 5:14 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Lesley!
22/1/24, 5:15 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 5:15 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 5:16 PM - Austin Edoofa: *Congratulations on your exemplary A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

So, are you available to move through the procedures?
22/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 78 990 3247: Thank you very much
22/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 78 990 3247: And yes iam available
22/1/24, 5:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome, Lesley!
22/1/24, 5:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: Do you know, we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

22/1/24, 6:07 PM - +263 78 990 3247: I am really interested in studying in India
22/1/24, 6:12 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is good to hear, Lesley!

22/1/24, 6:12 PM - Austin Edoofa: *A total of 370+ Edoofians from Zimbabwe were welcomed at the airport by our Edoofa team for the previous intake*.

22/1/24, 6:15 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, so have you discussed with them about their experiences of the SLICE Con'24 Industrial visit?

22/1/24, 6:17 PM - +263 78 990 3247: I am not aware of that

22/1/24, 6:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: At the same time, It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
22/1/24, 6:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
22/1/24, 6:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 6:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

22/1/24, 6:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
22/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 78 990 3247: I surely am
22/1/24, 7:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: Glad to hear that!
22/1/24, 7:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
22/1/24, 8:45 PM - +263 78 990 3247: Is it okay if i change the area of study?
22/1/24, 8:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: May I know, to which course would you like to change?
22/1/24, 9:28 PM - +263 78 990 3247: A bachelor in Commerce
22/1/24, 9:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Lesley
22/1/24, 9:28 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
22/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 78 990 3247: Can you jog my memory
22/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 78 990 3247: I cant recall
22/1/24, 9:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: Let me help you. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
22/1/24, 9:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
22/1/24, 9:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
22/1/24, 9:42 PM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
22/1/24, 9:42 PM - +263 78 990 3247: Ok....You discussed that with my father
22/1/24, 9:43 PM - +263 78 990 3247: He will answer the question that concern the finances
22/1/24, 9:49 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure Lesley, do you have any questions for me as of now?
22/1/24, 9:50 PM - +263 78 990 3247: I have one
22/1/24, 9:50 PM - +263 78 990 3247: Are career prospects guaranteed there
22/1/24, 9:57 PM - Austin Edoofa: After completing a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) in India, graduates can explore various career opportunities.

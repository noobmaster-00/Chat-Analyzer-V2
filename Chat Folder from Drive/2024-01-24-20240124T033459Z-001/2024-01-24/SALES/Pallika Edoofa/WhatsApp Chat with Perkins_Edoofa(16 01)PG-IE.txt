*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
18/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 365 4399: Am afraid Perkins is currently having lessons.The ideal time is during weekends
18/01/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that I understand, since schools in Zimbabwe have reopened, students are currently engaged in lessons and exam preparations, rendering them unavailable. This situation contrasts with Western African countries where students have already received their results. Consequently, there is a high likelihood that scholarship seats could be filled by students from these regions, posing a potential disadvantage for Zimbabwean students.

These factors particularly affect boarding students and those who are restricted from using devices in school. By the time they return, the opportunity may have been taken by other applicants. To address this concern, our Academic Board, in consultation with universities, has decided to allow parents to participate in the seat reservation interview for their children. This ensures that no deserving applicant is overlooked.
18/01/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So as of now parents do have a chance in representing their child under the evaluation process, so would it be possible for us to have a discussion regarding the same please?
18/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 365 4399: Yes we can discuss
18/01/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!

20/01/24, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Perkins, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.

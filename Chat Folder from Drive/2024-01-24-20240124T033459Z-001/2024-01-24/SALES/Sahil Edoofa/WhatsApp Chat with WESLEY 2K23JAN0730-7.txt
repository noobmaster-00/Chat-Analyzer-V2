I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 8:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 8:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 815 6959: Thank you sir
9/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 77 815 6959: Noted
9/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay Good morning sir
9/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 815 6959: Greetings to you Ms Siddhi
9/1/24, 11:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, @263778156959 . I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you today?
9/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 77 815 6959: I am good today and you
9/1/24, 12:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well. Thank you for asking. 

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 77 815 6959: I have decided to proceed with this project that gives me a task to get another who needs to study abroad
9/1/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is amazing, Wesley! I believe you will surely be able to succeed in it. 

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 815 6959: I think the problem is l was at school and the school so the school rule didn't allow cellphone s
9/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yah l think this is the right time to proceed
9/1/24, 12:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that you were focused on it to perform your best during examinations.

May I know if you are ready to proceed with your admission process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education right now?
9/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yes Ms l am ready
9/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, Wesley. Before we move ahead with your application process, I believe we need you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).

2. O-Level Results

3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)
9/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Out of the following, you have already shared your ID proof and O-level results with us. Could you please share the 1st document with me as well?
9/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Results are not yet out and  l have misplaced the statement of entry h
9/1/24, 1:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Is there any way you will be able to recover the statement of entry or an image of it?
9/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Let me ask my parents
9/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Please get back to me once you do.
9/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: By what time should I expect a reply from you?
9/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Maybe after 30 minutes
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, Wesley. I will be waiting for your response.
9/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Sorry sir my mother says the document is nowhere to be found
Is it crucial
9/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, dear. In that case you will have to provide us with a recommendation letter from your school which has details about your subject combination. Do you want me to brief you about the same?
9/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yes Ms you
9/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 815 6959: *can
9/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
9/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application. I hope the procedure is clear to you?
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Noted mam
9/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know by when you will be able to send the required document?
9/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay l will update you letter
9/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, may I know when I should reach out to you in order to take an update? In the meanwhile, we can move forward with your admission process.
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Sir l will to my parents then l will come to you with the update
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Also, you are talking to Ms. Siddhi Singh. I believe you mistakenly addressed me as sir.
9/1/24, 3:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with your application process. Shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 3:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Sorry mam
9/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yes mam we are
9/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Noted mam
9/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Wonderful
9/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, dear. It is only human nature to commit mistakes.
9/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Wesley. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
9/1/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
9/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay noted mam
9/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
9/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
9/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
9/1/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
9/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yah mam I have done
9/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
9/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
9/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.
9/1/24, 5:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
9/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Noted
9/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay mam
9/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Thank you mam
9/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
9/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
9/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay mam
9/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Noted
9/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Thank you mam l have understand
9/1/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Amazing thank you mam
9/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yes mam l have understand
9/1/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay mam
9/1/24, 5:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 5:50 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Noted
If my parents failed to pay the first 450 before 25 January and then
9/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Please provide me with more information about it
9/1/24, 6:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this query with me. I would like to address it after sharing all the relevant details with you, so that you don't miss out on important aspects.
9/1/24, 6:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 6:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 6:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
9/1/24, 6:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
9/1/24, 7:06 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay
9/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Thank you mam l have understand
9/1/24, 7:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
9/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yes l know mam thanks for the reminder
10/1/24, 7:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear.
Now, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yes l agree
10/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 815 6959: Yes mam it's clear
10/1/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 815 6959: That's amazing thank you mam
10/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy.

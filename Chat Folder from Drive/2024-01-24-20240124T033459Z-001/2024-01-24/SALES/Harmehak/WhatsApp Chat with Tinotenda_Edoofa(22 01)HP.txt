23/01/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Its a pleasure to know about you and Mr Mugadza!

He is the head master at which school please?
23/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 336 0264: He is at Gudza secondary school, which is in Gutu district, Masvingo province
23/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful!

We are proudly associated with Gutu High School as well from Gutu District, Mrs Blessing. <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Blessing, I would like to know Tinotenda better as a student!

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies?

I can see he wishes to pursue Computer Science.
23/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Tinotenda is a well behaved boy,who is involved in church charity groups and is currently the secretary of one of the groups.,He is a chess player and participates in basketball.ln chess last time he participated in the provincial tournament but unfortunately he did not manage to proceed to the national tournament
23/01/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Mrs Blessing!

It's a pleasure to know about him and his interests in sports as well!

Well I do understand, there's always a new opportunity for a missed one, isn't it?
23/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Yah sure Ms Harmehak,a new opportunity will always present itself
23/01/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
23/01/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
23/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Very confident of higher points Ms Harmehak
23/01/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So may I know more about his interests to pursue Computer Science?
23/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 336 0264: He is so much interested, During his spare time he is always on google learning more about  coding and programming
23/01/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful,

It's great to know his thorough interests to learn more.
23/01/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: I believe he is pursuing Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science at school please?
23/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 77 336 0264: That's his exact combination at school
23/01/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Blessing, would he like to pursue Btech Computer Science Engineering or Bachelor of science in computer science please?
23/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Btech Computer Science Engineering

23/01/24, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
23/01/24, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Blessing, meanwhile as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?

23/01/24, 6:28 pm - +263 77 336 0264: about
23/01/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Blessing.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/01/24, 6:32 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Am not familiar,may you furnish me with the details
23/01/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
23/01/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/01/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/01/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 6:44 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Quite good and helpful
23/01/24, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
23/01/24, 7:10 pm - +263 77 336 0264: That's really good and it makes it affordable for most students especially ours as we earn a little
23/01/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
23/01/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/01/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/01/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/01/24, 7:28 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Quite informative, thank you so much
23/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
23/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/01/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: I believe by now you have a great insight, Mrs Blessing?
23/01/24, 7:43 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Quite great indeed, thank you so much
23/01/24, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
23/01/24, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/01/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Mrs Blessing!

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be active for the next 10-15 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
23/01/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Yes am ready
23/01/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Blessing, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/01/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/01/24, 8:06 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Between $1500-$2250
23/01/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/01/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/01/24, 8:11 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Okay understood,so how do we go about it since Tinotenda is still in school
23/01/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: The parents would be participating in the entire discussion please!
23/01/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/01/24, 8:17 pm - +263 77 336 0264: I mean is it possible to enroll him before he sits for his advanced level exams or we should wait until next year when the results will be out
23/01/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity regarding the same!
23/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/01/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
23/01/24, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you understand how the enrollments are done early and how their time is utilised.
23/01/24, 8:30 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Okay understood,so isn't it possible for him to start this whole thing after his exams in December when he has ample time to fully concentrate on it
23/01/24, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: You see he would be alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist him with his projects and a thorough schedule that wouldn't harm his studies.
23/01/24, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/01/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
23/01/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
23/01/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process properly and how the entire application would be proceeding for the further stages? <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 8:38 pm - +263 77 336 0264: I understand but my only worry is, they are not allowed phones at their school so he would be inaccessible the whole term
23/01/24, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we are aware of the same as this the case with most students from who are in boarding schools like Dewure high itself!

Now for the same when the student is not available you would be proceeding ahead with the admissions process.
23/01/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
23/01/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/01/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/01/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: I hope you have followed the discussion so far please?

Feel free to share if you have any more questions Mrs Blessing. <This message was edited>
23/01/24, 9:09 pm - +263 77 336 0264: Okay shall come back to you later, the discussion was really quite informative, thank you a lot
23/01/24, 9:10 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/01/24, 9:10 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

12/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 379 7000: I am Belinda Dube and i am a girl aged 19.I have done my O'level in 2021 where I was doing nine subject and I managed to get 7Bs and 1C at Mt selinda high school then i proceeded to my A level where i was doing Family Religious Studies, History and Geography.My wish is to study law.My hobby is playing netball.

I come from a family of six members including my parents.My father is a teacher by profession and my mother is a nurse.One of my siblings is studying at chinhoyi university and the other one is doing her nursing course at Mount Selinda hospital.
12/01/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Belinda, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
12/01/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: I can see from what you expressed that your parents are leading a family that greatly values education.
12/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 78 379 7000: Thank you maam
12/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Well Belinda, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

12/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 379 7000: Yes i believe it and also wish to study abroad since I was a kid

12/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 379 7000: Yes i am
12/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Belinda, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

12/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 379 7000: Yes they are willing to support me but there are some challenges on financial since my other sister is still at the University
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: While I understand,

I believe they are willing to support you along with the scholarship, Belinda?
12/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 379 7000: I think that way it will be possible
12/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I understand.
12/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 379 7000: I am confident that i will aim higher
12/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: That's great
12/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: So, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?
12/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 379 7000: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 379 7000: I wanted to study law because it is a noble profession and I can assist people even after retirement age
12/01/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Received please
12/01/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing,

Let me brief you about your desired course now.
12/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 379 7000: Oky

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development.

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

12/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Belinda
12/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Alright Belinda, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Thank you once again for  your compliment.If provided with this career option since it takes 5 years to Complete the program that would mean i will be 24 yrs and a young lawyer with a wide array of opportunities before me to choose from.A great career ahead.It may need my looking back at my achievement,what I did best during the study and choose from what i will anticipated to follow through my achievement during the past five years of study.
12/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 379 7000: As of Edoofa ,it will be time to celebrate our collection achievement and dream
12/01/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Belinda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Apart from the challenges we are facing in Zimbabwe as a nation currently .That is in choosing a perfect career path and economic woes .Studying abroad will not only offer me better career opportunities and an open mindset divorced from what i see and experience here back home.
12/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: You see, Belinda, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Regarding that it is the truth here and i was wondering what is wrong with our education system. I am afraid studying at any university here would lead to a cenario of a similar nature. That is not my dream. This is one of the reasons among others. I would be more than willing to embrace the Edoofa program. It is not my dream to study law to sell airtym in the street
12/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand Belinda
12/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation. <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I have heard ofEdoofa from my high school teachers and the idea of studying in india.

12/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Belinda

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 379 7000: No am not aware
12/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 379 7000: How does the LEARN WHILE YOU EARN  program operate
12/01/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: I shall assist you regarding the same.
12/01/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Belinda, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
12/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Thank you
12/01/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
12/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I think that would be much more affordable and inclined to work hard on the student for better marks
12/01/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Belinda!
12/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same, are you aware that the child of the Deputy Head of the school is also a part of the Edoofa scholarship program?
12/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Am not aware
The deputy head of Mt selinda?
12/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Ennie
12/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Isn't it exciting to know the same now?
12/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Yes it is
12/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Is it possible to return to Zimbabwe for the holiday before competing
12/01/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: That's your choice please.

You can either go back, or stay here in India and explore the country.
12/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky
12/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
12/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Ok thank you
12/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

12/01/24, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: By when shall I expect to hear from you?
12/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Maybe 6 o'clock
12/01/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

Meanwhile you can participate using your parent's device too.

Or you can request them to participate.
12/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky
12/01/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
12/01/24, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected, Mr Dube?
12/01/24, 6:02 pm - Harmehak: I am here to continue as discussed!
12/01/24, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/01/24, 7:20 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Ok mam
12/01/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the discussion, Belinda?
12/01/24, 7:22 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Am reading this that massage now since my phone was off
12/01/24, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!

Thoroughly follow the shared resources, I would complete our discussion as you were facing challenges.
12/01/24, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 7:27 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Ok  thank you
12/01/24, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 7:38 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I will be earning this credits how 
Will I be engaging in some projects
12/01/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Did you go through the same?
12/01/24, 7:41 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky. what are some of the project done
12/01/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/01/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity?
12/01/24, 7:44 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I now understand
12/01/24, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/01/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 7:46 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I wanted to ask that if i complete my studies will you help me with finding a job
12/01/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
12/01/24, 7:48 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky
12/01/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same too, Belinda?
12/01/24, 7:50 pm - +263 78 379 7000: No the video is still downloading there are some network issues
12/01/24, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, you can go through the same, once you have downloaded it.
12/01/24, 7:52 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky I will
12/01/24, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: So Belinda, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well.

However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 7:53 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Yes am ready
12/01/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Belinda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/01/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 7:56 pm - +263 78 379 7000: So this means must apply 1 university
12/01/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: No please, this is the case for students who apply without Edoofa!

Since there is no guarantee of admission students happen to apply to 4-5 universities!
12/01/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: How much does a student spend without Edoofa, Belinda?
12/01/24, 8:00 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky I understand
12/01/24, 8:01 pm - +263 78 379 7000: If it's 300 and apply 5 universities it will be 1500
12/01/24, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/01/24, 8:03 pm - +263 78 379 7000: This is very affordable
12/01/24, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: You see, Belinda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so? <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 8:08 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I understand and I will be so happy to be part of the Edoofa
12/01/24, 8:10 pm - +263 78 379 7000: So what about language as some will not understand hindi
12/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/01/24, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Your lectures will be in English, itself!

People here in India communicate very well in English, language won't be a barrier for you!
12/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky I got it
12/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Thats good!
12/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 8:19 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I understand and when will be my step 2
12/01/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: We will begin tomorrow, Belinda.
12/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/01/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

12/01/24, 8:22 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky I got it
12/01/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/01/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Do connect Mrs Ruth with your parents as well, Belinda!
12/01/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/01/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/01/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/01/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: No please, she feels it's great to assist other students just like her own so that they can benefit from the opportunity as well, whenever she has time. <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Dear Belinda and parents,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “13-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
12/01/24, 8:42 pm - +263 78 379 7000: I have go through it now
12/01/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
12/01/24, 8:44 pm - +263 78 379 7000: Oky  I understand
13/01/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
13/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 78 379 7000: Am doing well

I don't have any question
13/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

How was the discussion with your parents?
13/01/24, 11:35 am - +263 78 379 7000: Well it was good and they say they are more than willing to sent me there to study
13/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate their support.
13/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
13/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 379 7000: Not yet maybe in the evening because now my parents have gone somewhere
13/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: I do understand,

However meanwhile you can connect, Belinda.
13/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 379 7000: Okay
13/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Yes please
13/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

13/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 379 7000: Oky
13/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: You can go through the video, Belinda.
13/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
13/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 78 379 7000: I have seen it it was amazing seeing the other students happy
13/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

We look forward to having you join this year's event in Zimbabwe and later on welcome you in India, along with all other students from Mt Selinda High!
13/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: So Belinda, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

13/01/24, 4:38 pm - +263 78 379 7000: It is true that many Africans have poor diets due to a number of factors, including the stagnation and inefficiency of their farms. Africa's farming systems have struggled to keep up with population growth, leading to food shortages and malnutrition. Many farmers lack access to modern farming techniques, such as improved seeds, fertilizer, and irrigation. This makes it difficult for them to increase yields and produce enough food to meet the needs of their families and communities. In addition, many African farmers face challenges such as limited access to markets, lack of credit, and poor infrastructure.

Many Africans are having poor diets and are becoming unhealthy because of their farms which are stegnent and inefficient.many Africans have farms which are not fertile and are not good for practicing agriculture and at the end of the day they will lead to poor diet.

Some of their farms have soils which are not good at draining water which means water will not sink into the soil and this cause water logging and damages crops like maize which do not want a lot of water, therefore this will also lead to poor diet as there will be little or no haverst.

Also,many Africans have poor diet because they has little knowledge on how to apply fertilizers and manure. Sometimes they apply few and sometimes they apply more than needed and this will lead to crop failure and therefore leads to poor diet.

It is also important to note that the challenges facing african farmers are complex and cannot be attributed to a single factor . Inaddition the issues mentioned above, climate change is also having a major impact on african agriculture. Drought,floods and other weather events are becoming more common making it even more difficult for farmers to produce enough food . Additionally, conflict, political instability and corruption can also make it difficult for farmers to access the resources they need.

Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve African agriculture and food security.

When I was a child, I saw the effects of malnutrition firsthand, as my siblings and I suffered from stunted growth and other health problems. When I was in my early teens, I decided that I wanted to do something to help improve the lives of my family and my community. I knew that the key to making a difference was improving agriculture and making it more efficient and productive. I decided to become a farmer, and I learned everything I could about farming techniques and new

19/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Yes please?

19/01/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Yes please!

Anything else that you would like to ask, Belinda?
19/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 379 7000: No I don't have
19/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

Now shall I brief you about the payment modes in detail?
19/01/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 379 7000: Yes
19/01/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
19/01/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
19/01/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: 2 contacts.vcf (file attached)

19/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 379 7000: Oky
19/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, now any queries, Belinda?
19/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 379 7000: I have no queries
19/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: So how excited are you to score a higher quantum of scholarship, Belinda?
19/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 78 379 7000: Am very excited because I always feel like am not going to make it
19/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: While I do understand,

It's always good to have faith in yourself, Belinda!
19/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 379 7000: Yes 
But there are some situation where you completely loose faith in yourself
19/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: I understand.

I believe scoring the scholarship must have encouraged you to regain the faith, isn't it?
19/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 379 7000: Yes
19/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: I am glad it could help!

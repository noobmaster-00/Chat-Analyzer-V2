I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Davie will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Davie is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:32 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Good evening, sir Dev. The best time would be from 1 to 2, possibly .
9/1/24, 8:34 PM - +27 78 760 0842: I have signed most parts of the forms once all is finalized I will share with you.

12/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Davie!
I hope all of you are doing great. Thank you for letting me know and I have taken note of the time slot that will be most suitable for you. Kindly provide me some time to realign my schedule according to your availability and then I will share my confirmation. Till the time, please be patient and allow us some time.
12/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then with great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
12/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 3:06 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Wow, I'm so proud of them
12/1/24, 3:08 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Good afternoon, sir it's really exciting.
15/1/24, 9:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Davie and Guardians/Parents! I hope all of you are doing great. I am doing good as well. To ensure a smooth admission process, we will have our session at 1:00 PM tomorrow to take forward our conversation. I hope you are going to be available for the same. We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night.
16/1/24, 6:17 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Good morning, noted.
16/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Guardians/Parents and Davie!
How are you all doing?
16/1/24, 1:11 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Good afternoon sir, Davie brother  Harrison,  I am doing well and you ?
16/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing good as well. Thank you for asking.
16/1/24, 1:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are ready to take forward our session? <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 1:21 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes
16/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Thank you for sharing the printed forms, we have taken note of it and update them in our records.
16/1/24, 1:26 PM - +27 78 760 0842: My pleasure.
16/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/1/24, 1:28 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, let's start.
16/1/24, 1:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 1:36 PM - +27 78 760 0842: I have gone through this cycle.
16/1/24, 1:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/1/24, 1:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, they are.
16/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/1/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/1/24, 1:40 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, I am following.
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/1/24, 1:48 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes they are.
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes we can.
16/1/24, 2:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/1/24, 2:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/1/24, 2:04 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes,
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
16/1/24, 2:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Mr. Harrison, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you and Davie around 30 minutes if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please let me know if you are clear about this?

17/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Davie!

17/1/24, 12:19 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Good afternoon, sir. We are fine here, just it's hot here  in Capetown and  you, sir?
17/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine here. It is actually quite the opposite here. We are experiencing freezing winters here, especially in the northern plains.
17/1/24, 12:32 PM - +27 78 760 0842: I appreciate that you are all fine, sir.
17/1/24, 12:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much, Mr. Harrison. Now on that note, let us begin with our session for today!

17/1/24, 1:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! May I Please ask you to share your understanding of each of the 4 videos.
17/1/24, 1:15 PM - +27 78 760 0842: The first video is all talking about the scholarship credits, which are obtained through the learning while you earn programs and the second one there are talking more of general in whish they have started to be open minded and follow the instructions. While in video three the co founders have shared the information of parental guides where I myself I salute them. They are talking about being skillfully, knowledge and attitude are the key to success in life, they also include that they don't just sit but there 10years of hard work is there for everyone to see. The last video is all about statements of purpose which is more dependent on a student to convince the university why they chose a particular course.
17/1/24, 1:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of Davie's university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

18/1/24, 10:44 AM - +27 78 760 0842: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 3:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @27787600842 !
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the statement of purpose, I have taken note of it and will update it in our records as well. We have a session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
18/1/24, 3:20 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Good afternoon, sir. I am really doing well, and you  there, how are you doing?. Yes I am  ready.
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine. Thanks for asking. Let's start with our session!
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
18/1/24, 3:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
18/1/24, 3:26 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Of course I am remaining with 150 us dollars which due date is on Thursday next week. And I will do the payment Monday or Tuesday.
18/1/24, 3:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know. I have taken note of it as well.
18/1/24, 3:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Davie has selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that he is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/1/24, 3:29 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, it's accurate.
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
18/1/24, 3:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
18/1/24, 3:39 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Year
18/1/24, 3:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I get a little more clarity about this reply? I am not able to understand.
18/1/24, 3:42 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, I am  wondering if you may elaborate more.
18/1/24, 3:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
18/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
18/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
18/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
18/1/24, 3:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
18/1/24, 3:54 PM - +27 78 760 0842: It is indeed something that we would like
18/1/24, 3:54 PM - +27 78 760 0842: We would like to have
18/1/24, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
18/1/24, 3:59 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes please
18/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
18/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
18/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
18/1/24, 4:03 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, we were informed like that.
18/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
18/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
18/1/24, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
18/1/24, 4:09 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Of course.
18/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Malawi you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
18/1/24, 4:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 1685 Malawi Kwacha, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
18/1/24, 4:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
18/1/24, 4:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
18/1/24, 4:25 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Right.
18/1/24, 4:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
18/1/24, 4:32 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes please
18/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 25-January-2024
18/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
18/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
18/1/24, 4:38 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes
18/1/24, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
18/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
18/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
18/1/24, 4:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
18/1/24, 4:51 PM - +27 78 760 0842: It is amazing  and I am delighted of it but such will need a better family discussion among our family.
18/1/24, 4:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
18/1/24, 4:52 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes
18/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
18/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
18/1/24, 4:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
18/1/24, 4:58 PM - +27 78 760 0842: I like the sound of it
18/1/24, 4:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
18/1/24, 4:59 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes I have.
18/1/24, 5:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
18/1/24, 5:04 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Alright, thank  you so much.
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow at 4:30 PM to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
18/1/24, 5:06 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Thank you so much, wishing you also a good day.
20/1/24, 7:47 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Hello, admission officer, I am now in touch with my Ewyl mentor, and her name is Ms. Aditi. She has scheduled the sessions to Monday 8: 30 am to 9: 30 am, and the sessions will be every weekdays.
22/1/24, 10:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Harrison and Davie!
I hope you are doing well and are having a wonderful start to the week. I am glad to hear that you were able to connect with your EWYL mentor and are ready to start your EWYL sessions with her. All the best for these sessions and I hope you are going to have a great time interacting in these sessions. We will reconnect today at 4:30 PM to take forward our conversation. Till then wishing you a great day ahead!
22/1/24, 4:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Harrison and Davie!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 4:44 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Good afternoon sir, yes  I am ready.
22/1/24, 5:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know if you have discussed the Edoofa Secure Plan with your family?
22/1/24, 5:10 PM - +27 78 760 0842: We discussed it, and we  think that at this time, the best for us is to keep our savings until may be after his final exams, which will be in June, July. Thereafter, we may then consider this edoofa secure plan
22/1/24, 7:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern, but Mr. Harrison at the time the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is not going to be valid as this plan ensures that the parents or guardians can start preparing at the start of this plan and eventually save the amount accordingly. But if you start around June/July, you may not have sufficient savings to have at the time of admission into universities. I hope you understand my concern?
22/1/24, 7:37 PM - +27 78 760 0842: I totally understand that, but I will be ready for everything by then.
23/1/24, 9:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you will be able to manage by then Mr. Harrison. So may I please ask you to send me a breakup of the finances, starting from June to November, how much money you will deposit every month so that you can save $1500 at the end of November? It will help us to get clarity on your plan of preparation and prepare for the further timelines accordingly.
23/1/24, 9:44 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Good  evening, sir. I am starting to save for him from this month, and by that time, I will have that amount without a shadow of a doubt. I like edoofa secure plan, but I will just borrow your plan, and I am not sending it to you monthly now. Until such time comes, then I will release the money to you.

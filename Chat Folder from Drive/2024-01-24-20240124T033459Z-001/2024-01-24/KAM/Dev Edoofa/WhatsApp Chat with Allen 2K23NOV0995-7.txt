4/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Good evening sir
Yes I am ready
4/1/24, 7:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/1/24, 7:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes they are clear
4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir
4/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir
4/1/24, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok sir
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok sir u can

I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams.

I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263778104432 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Good morning sir.
So as of this year I'm writing my final examinations. I'm a bit scared but am willing to risk it all I really wish to pass with flying colors. I want to make a difference in the world and become a successful somebody to make myself and those that look up to me proud.
12/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that your academics are your main priority and want to become a better version of yourself by helping others in need. This is something that is much appreciated to hear from such young minds who are already mature enough to be aware of the aspects they need to work on. I must commend this.
12/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
12/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 810 4432: I think 6PM would be alright
23/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello sir

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes I am
4/1/24, 1:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 741 8328: I went through the image
4/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 741 8328: yes they are
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
4/1/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Okay I'm understanding we can go
4/1/24, 2:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/1/24, 2:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes I'm following
4/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 741 8328: We can start sir
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 741 8328: I'm ready you can share all the videos
4/1/24, 2:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 9:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know Shantel. We will discuss the videos in our session tomorrow.

12/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 741 8328: 2) A right is the freedom to express yourself without fear of persecution,while a duty is the responsibility to respect the rights of others. Rights are often negative , meaning that they involve not doing something. For example the right to free speech means that you cannot be punished for speaking your mind , whereas duties are often positive, meaning that they involve doing something. For example, the duty to obey the law means that you must follow the rules set by society. Rights are generally seen as something that the individual has, and which society obligated to respect. For example right to privacy, Whilst, duties are seen as something that the individuas owes to society for example to pay text. On the other hand ,human right is the right to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter while, civil right is the right to vote or own property, which may vary from country to country. Human rights are universal whilst civil rights vary form county to country .

12/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 741 8328: 3) A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for the government and represents the State in criminal cases. They are hired by the State. An attorney,on the other hand ,is a general term for any lawyer who has been admitted to practice law. Prosecutors are typically assigned to cases by the government, while attorneys can choose which cases they want to take on in other areas of law like civil or corporate law. Prosecutors have more power and authority than attorneys, but they also face more scrutiny and criticism from the public. Prosecutors also have the power to bring charges against someone and decide what charges to pursue, while attorneys can only defend their Clients in court. Prosecutors have access to a wide range of resources, like investigators and crime labs , while attorneys typically do not have. Prosecutors have a duty to uphold the law , while attorneys have a duty to represent their Clients .
12/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 741 8328: 4) As a hypothetical student interested in becoming a criminal lawyer, I would be most interested in pursuing criminal law. It is a very challenging and demanding field and i believe that i have the skills and abilities necessary to succeed in this field. There are many reasons for this, but the main reason is that I believe in the importance of justice and fairness. Criminal law is the branch of law that deals with crime and punishment, and it plays a vital role in ensuring that everyone is treated equally and fairly under the law. In addition, criminal law is constantly evolving, which means that there are always new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I also believe that criminal law is a very important field because it helps to protect the public from harm and makes our communities safer. Lastly, i believe that working as a criminal lawyer would be a very rewarding experience, both professionally and personally
12/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 741 8328: 5) l believe that I have several skills that would make me a successful criminal lawyer. First, I have excellent research skills, which are essential for finding the right legal precedents and evidence to support my arguments. Also I have a strong analytical mind, which allows me to understand complex legal issues and present them in a clear and concise manner. I am a very patient person, which is important for dealing with the sometimes lengthy and stressful process of a criminal trial.For example a case might take 2 -3 years . Furthermore, i am also good at time management which will enable me to complete tasks on time . For example it is crucial for meeting deadlines . I also have a good verbal communication, this is an essential skill for a criminal lawyer, who needs to be able to effectively communicate with judges , juries and other lawyers . Lastly i have a high degree of self confidence which will help me in gaining trust of clients and also will go a long way in winning cases

15/1/24, 9:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shantel!
How are you all doing?
15/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 741 8328: We are all fine Sir how are you
15/1/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing good as well. Thank you for asking.
15/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
15/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: After catching these glimpses, are you excited to attend such kind of conferences when you come to India?
15/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes, I will be very excited to attend such events and meet renowned figures when I come to India.
15/1/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great! Now on that note, Let's start with our session!
15/1/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Are you ready?
15/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes iam ready to start our session
15/1/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
15/1/24, 10:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
15/1/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
15/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 77 741 8328: Thank you for the reminder! I appreciate you keeping track of my progress and ensuring that I'm on the right track. I apologize for the delay in payments. My preparations have been going great! I'm glad that I'm able to engage in meaningful discussions with you, which have helped me understand the of the whole process
15/1/24, 10:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
15/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 77 741 8328: Oky sir thank you
15/1/24, 10:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: We are delighted that you are able to grow through these conversations.
15/1/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/1/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
15/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes sir that's correct
15/1/24, 10:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
15/1/24, 10:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
15/1/24, 10:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
15/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 741 8328: ‘Yes, please do share more with me
15/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
15/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
15/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
15/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
15/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
15/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 77 741 8328: yes I do feel that it is important for my family to have such financial plans
15/1/24, 11:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
15/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes you can go ahead
15/1/24, 11:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
15/1/24, 11:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
15/1/24, 11:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
15/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes I agree with this and this can also reduce burden to parents
15/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
15/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
15/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
15/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes I can see the benefit of this plan
15/1/24, 12:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
15/1/24, 12:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
15/1/24, 12:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
15/1/24, 12:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
15/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 741 8328: I think it is safe to keep the savings in the bank and its also true that a Nostro account is needed
15/1/24, 12:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
15/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes sir, you can explain
15/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 21-January-2024
15/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
15/1/24, 12:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
15/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes can you clearly explain on this one
15/1/24, 12:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
15/1/24, 12:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
15/1/24, 12:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
15/1/24, 12:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
15/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available? @263777418328
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 741 8328: I was in class sir
15/1/24, 1:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, Shantel!
15/1/24, 1:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: What do you feel about this?
15/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 741 8328: This will be good for both me as a student and my parents
15/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
15/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes its correct
15/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
15/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
15/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket.

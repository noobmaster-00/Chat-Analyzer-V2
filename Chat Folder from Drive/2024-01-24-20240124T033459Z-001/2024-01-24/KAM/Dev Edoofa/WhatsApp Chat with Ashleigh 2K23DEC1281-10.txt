We can proceed 
I wanted to ask about the  EWYL schedule
Because I'm resuming school on the 8th of January
So I wanted to know if there is a schedule so that I will check when I will be fully free at school and squeeze in time for the program
28/12/23, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have taken a note of this as well, Ashleigh. You will soon get to know about your EWYL schedule during the further process.

28/12/23, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
28/12/23, 9:46 AM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted sir 
It's clear
28/12/23, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
28/12/23, 10:02 AM - +263 78 866 7478: A lot of things impressed me 
I liked how my counselor was welcoming and patient with me throughout my application, it really made me feel warm towards the Edoofa program 
I also liked the Earn while you learn program the most because I have  always wanted to be a little independent with my studies at an early age and  I am happy that the program is going to cater for that 
Knowing that many Zimbabweans came that side through Edoofa made me interested and want to be part of the family 
So basically most of the aspects of the program impressed me <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have known the counselor for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track.

28/12/23, 11:02 AM - +263 78 866 7478: I am usually free in the afternoon when I am at school that is from 3PM to 4PM 
I don't know if an hour will be enough for the sessions 
But our school timetable is going to change since we are starting a new grade.
We might have afternoon lessons but not only daily basis 
So for my sessions whilst I am at school,is it okay if I update you when I'm at school?
But during holidays I will be free around 12 after my last lesson
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - +263 78 866 7478: So we can have the session from 12 to 1 if it's okay?

It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
28/12/23, 11:12 AM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted sir 
I'm going to my school tomorrow to try and get the recommendation letter from the headmaster

28/12/23, 11:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 pm for our next session.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

2/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 866 7478: You’re welcome

2/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 78 866 7478: I am done
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: are you clear, Ashleigh?
2/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Yes i am
2/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: have you noted this Ashleigh?
2/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Yes noted sir
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 866 7478: I have a lesson starting in a few minutes sir can we proceed tomorrow?
2/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay Ashleigh, I completely understand.
I am sharing with you 4 videos that you have to watch to complete the first step of the admission cycle.

9/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: We will move forward with the process after you are completely done with the answers to the document.

9/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 78 866 7478: 2)Rights and duties are two important concepts that often go hand-in-hand. A right is something that a person is entitled to have or do, while a duty is something that a person is obligated to do. Rights and duties can be positive or negative, meaning that they can involve either a right to something or a duty to refrain from something. For example, the right to life is a positive right, while the duty not to murder is a negative duty.
Human rights are rights that belong to all people by virtue of being human, while civil rights are rights that are granted by a government or legal system. Human rights are often.Examples of human rights include the right to life,the right to freedom from inhuman treatment,the right to freedom of assembly and association.Civil rights are rights that are specific to a particular country or jurisdiction and can include things like right to vote
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 866 7478: 3)The difference between a prosecutor and an attorney is that a prosecutor is a legal representative of the state or government, while an attorney is a legal representative of a client. Prosecutors are responsible for bringing criminal charges against individuals, while attorneys can work on behalf of clients in both criminal and civil cases. Prosecutors are employed by the government, while attorneys can be employed by law firms, businesses, or individuals. In some cases, an attorney may even work as a prosecutor. Overall, prosecutors and attorneys share some similarities, but there are also important differences between the two roles.A prosecutor is limited to criminal cases.His or her job is to bring charges against an individual while is suspected of committing a crime.They mudt gather evidence and present it to the judge or jury and try to prove that the accused individual is indeed guilty.If the accused is found guilty the prosecutor will work to determine an appropriate punishment.On the other hand an attorney can work on both criminal and civil cases.Civil cases involve disputes between individuals or organizations
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 78 866 7478: 4)I am more interested in civil law because:
- Civil law is important because it helps to resolve disputes between individuals and organizations in a fair and just way.
- Civil law can be complex and challenging, which can make it intellectually stimulating and rewarding to work in.
- Civil law allows for the resolution of disputes without the use of violence or force.
- Civil law is constantly evolving, which means that there are always new and interesting developments to keep up with.
- Working in civil law can allow you to help people who have been wronged and need assistance in getting <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 866 7478: it's also worth noting that civil law can have a significant impact on people's lives. For example, if someone is injured due to the negligence of another person or organization, they may be able to file a civil lawsuit and receive compensation for their injuries. This compensation can help to cover medical expenses, lost wages, and other costs associated with the injury. In addition, civil law can also be used to protect people's rights and freedoms, such as the right to free speech or the right to due process.
11/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 78 866 7478: 5)
- Excellent communication skills: A lawyer needs to be able to communicate effectively with clients, judges, and other legal professionals. This includes being able to explain complex legal concepts in a clear and concise manner, as well as being a good listener and being able to negotiate effectively.I am the head of Jury of the interact club at my school this proves my ability to communicate with people.
- Critical thinking skills: A lawyer needs to be able to analyze a situation, identify the relevant issues, and come up with a creative solution. This requires the ability to think logically and critically, as well as being able to anticipate the potential outcomes of different.I passed my o level history this proves my abilities too.
11/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 78 866 7478: I am a problem solver:Lawyers need to be able to identify potential problems and come up with creative solutions. This can involve finding legal precedents, drafting creative arguments, or proposing alternative resolutions to a dispute. Problem-solving also requires the ability to think outside the box and be flexible in your approach.

16/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
16/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
16/1/24, 11:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
16/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes Sir I think it's better to get information as early as possible to avoid last minute rashing.
16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is very true @263772660042!
16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
16/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes Sir from what I have read. It's true that the Edoofa Secure Plan is essential because it makes the preparation easy
16/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
16/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes Sir please go ahead
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
16/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes I do agree Sir that's correct
16/1/24, 12:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
16/1/24, 12:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
16/1/24, 12:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
16/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes Sir that's correct
16/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
16/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
16/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
16/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
16/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes that's true
16/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
16/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes please go ahead Sir
16/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 26-January-2024.
16/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
16/1/24, 12:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
16/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes why 10 months
16/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
16/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
16/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
16/1/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
16/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 266 0042: It's in order as long as there are no changes made after I have already paid the money to disadvantage me as a parent
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is correct @263772660042.
16/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes Sir
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 266 0042: It sounds good and it will make it easier for me to raise the ticket fare
16/1/24, 2:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is correct! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
16/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Yes Sir I have I will ask the whole family to go through it so that they get to understand it as well
16/1/24, 6:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
16/1/24, 6:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good night, and please extend our regards to your family.
16/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 77 266 0042: Thank you so much for a fruitful day.Pass my regards to your family too and have a blessed night. We will reconnect once we are done.

20/1/24, 9:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
20/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 78 866 7478: Greetings sir Dev 
We’re glad that you are feeling better now
20/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 78 866 7478: We are not
20/1/24, 9:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes for my recovery.
20/1/24, 9:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
20/1/24, 9:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
20/1/24, 9:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
20/1/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family, I am certain that Ashleigh too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.

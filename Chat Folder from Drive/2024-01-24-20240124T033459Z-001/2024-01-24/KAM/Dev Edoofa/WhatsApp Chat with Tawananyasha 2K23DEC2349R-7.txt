With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

12/1/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/1/24, 3:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear? <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 78 827 8861: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 827 8861: They are very clear
12/1/24, 3:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/1/24, 3:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 827 8861: Yes, iam following
12/1/24, 3:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/1/24, 3:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 827 8861: Noted , all the steps are very clear
12/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 78 827 8861: Yes
12/1/24, 3:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/1/24, 3:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
12/1/24, 3:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: I will be sharing the videos now
12/1/24, 3:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

13/1/24, 8:10 AM - +263 78 827 8861: Good morning Admission Officer and the Head of Admission
13/1/24, 8:27 AM - +263 78 827 8861: From the videos that I have gone through I have understood that in order to have a successful journey with Edoofa a student has to follow instructions and be open minded. Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the SEELS program, but it is focused on increasing student's capacity for success, making students more responsible and independent. Also the founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for the prestigious institutions that Edoofa has invested a lot of time to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians. Lastly they talked about the Statement of purpose which is an important document in which students should be prompt in taking action , and be diligent in filling out the form.
13/1/24, 8:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tawananyasha!
How are you all doing?
13/1/24, 8:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
13/1/24, 8:47 AM - +263 78 827 8861: Yes we are
13/1/24, 8:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that!
13/1/24, 8:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities.
13/1/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

15/1/24, 8:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Tawananyasha and Parents! I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the screenshots of the Statement of Purpose. I have taken note of these and will update them in our records.
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 392 2247: Goodmorning
15/1/24, 8:43 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Good morning Admission Officer and Head of Admissions....
We are very well thank you and how are you
Tawananyasha has gone to school ......today she will give you an update  of her school time table
15/1/24, 8:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Mrs. Mushambi. I have taken note of this information.
15/1/24, 8:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I please know, if you as a parent are available for further conversation right now?
15/1/24, 8:47 AM - +263 77 629 8068: You are welcome
15/1/24, 8:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because later in the day when Tawananyasha is going to be available, I will be occupied with meetings. I hope you understand?
15/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 629 8068: If we can be of help  please go ahead  and talk to us ....
15/1/24, 8:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are ready to take part in these sessions.
15/1/24, 8:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: We have successfully concluded the second step of Tawanyasha's university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in her admission journey. we can move towards the third step of the admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
15/1/24, 8:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
15/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Thus where the challenge  but , my own thinking is can you please post what ever you want to post for her today ...when she comes back she herself will respond to the posts so that when ever you will go online you will also be able to see her posts back to you
The other thing is  that they are not allowed to carry phones to school
15/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes
15/1/24, 8:55 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Thank you very much
15/1/24, 8:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand, Mrs Mushambi. But for today's conversation there needs to be active discussion. I hope you understand?
15/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes we still stand by our promise that we will pay our balance of 150 dollars before the 6th of February 2024
15/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 629 8068: It's alright
15/1/24, 8:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that. Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
15/1/24, 9:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA Fashion Designing and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Iam very sure  about what I'm saying *Sir* we will pay
15/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Very accurate
15/1/24, 9:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
15/1/24, 9:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
15/1/24, 9:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
15/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 629 8068: You are very right
15/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 629 8068: True
15/1/24, 9:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
15/1/24, 9:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
15/1/24, 9:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
15/1/24, 9:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
15/1/24, 9:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
15/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Please go ahead
15/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
15/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
15/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
15/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Thank you for teaching about how it takes for us as parents how things that are ahead of us stands
15/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Alright
15/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Very well informed
15/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes we agree
15/1/24, 9:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! Now, moving forward, This means that by the time you are in India, you will have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
15/1/24, 9:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
15/1/24, 9:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
15/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Understood
15/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
15/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different. <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Very well
15/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
15/1/24, 9:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
15/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Very clear we are getting you
15/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 629 8068: True
15/1/24, 9:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
15/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 629 8068: True
15/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Right
15/1/24, 9:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
15/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Please explain
15/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of 6 February 2024. <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
15/1/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
15/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 629 8068: We did not say we pay by tomorrow
15/1/24, 9:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: There was a typing mistake, the word tomorrow should not be there. I hope you understand?
15/1/24, 9:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have now edited the message as well.
15/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Yes
15/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 629 8068: We're getting you
15/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Right
15/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Noted
15/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Noted
15/1/24, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
15/1/24, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
15/1/24, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
15/1/24, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
15/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Noted
15/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Noted
15/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Noted
15/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 77 629 8068: It sounds good
15/1/24, 9:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
15/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Correct
15/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
15/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
15/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
15/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 629 8068: It sounds good
15/1/24, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
15/1/24, 9:53 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Understood
15/1/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
15/1/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family members? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
15/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Thank you
15/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 77 629 8068: We will have the discussions this evening
15/1/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
15/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 629 8068: Thank you most... have a great day
15/1/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome.
17/1/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tawananyasha and Parents!
How are you all doing?
17/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Good Afternoon our Admission Officer.....How are you doing together ...with our Head of Admissions.... We are sorry  we have been busy   of recent  ...any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted
17/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 629 8068: We had a detailed discussion with my family and we have two questions
17/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 629 8068: 1 is it compulsory to have a Nostrol Account with FBC?
17/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 629 8068: 2 Suppose well run out of cash   one certain month  ....and we fail to deposit the 150 dollars  ... how best can you help us ?
17/1/24, 4:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: It is compulsory to have a Nostro Account to have a bank statement which is a requirement when applying for a visa as well as the as well as it is a US Dollar account which helps in international transactions. However, it is not compulsory to have nostro account with FBC bank. You can have a nostro account in any of your preferred banks.
17/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 629 8068: Thank you very much for the clarification  it's very clear
17/1/24, 5:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern, and where you are coming from. If I was in your position, I would have had the same concern. After counseling thousands of students over the years, I have a small question. Why do you think such a situation can arise, as you are surely going to be saving some amount for Tawananyasha's higher education in India?

22/1/24, 5:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are completely aligned with the Edoofa Secure Plan. Now moving forward, to ensure the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide upon the month from which this plan is going to start and a fixed date on which you will positively deposit $150 every month. 

Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail of these opportunities, We completely understand that every parent can't make the payment on our specified date. So considering this situation, we let them decide the plan initiation month and date according to their comfort. So, may I know from what month you wish to start this plan, as well as the fixed date of every month on which you will be able to deposit $150 every month?

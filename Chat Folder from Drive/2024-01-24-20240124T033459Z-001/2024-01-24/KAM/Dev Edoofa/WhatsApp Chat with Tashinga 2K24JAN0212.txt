16/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Certainly, sir. My name is Tashinga Prunella Musonza, an ambitious and dedicated individual with a strong passion for academics, making a global impact and leadership. I thoroughly enjoy both reading and creating educational content, which is evident in my role as the Head Facilitator for STEM-. This position showcases my empathetic nature, as I strive to support and guide others in their learning journey. Additionally, serving as a Junior Parliamentarian has further fueled my desire to study Law, as it has instilled in me the importance of advocating for the rights and well-being of others. I am highly self-critical and constantly strive for excellence in all that I do. As the second child in my family, I am fortunate to have a loving and supportive household that encourages me to reach my fullest potential. My father and mother generously sponsor my education and have consistently demonstrated their dedication to nurturing my career growth. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Good day Sir. Here is trusting that I find you well. Had been in a Zoom meeting since midday but glad to say I have been freed now. Please be assured that you have a complete buy in from us concerning our daughter Tashinga's enrolment process which is underway. We support this worthy initiative without equivocation. In addition we stand prepared to do our part as her patents/guardians in ensuring that all the necessary steps are taken and satisfactorily concluded. Please accept my warmest regards.
16/1/24, 3:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: We surely appreciate your kind words for us. Thank you so much!
16/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you Tashinga for providing your detailed introduction. We appreciate your hard work and forward thinking of making an impact. There is a very small percentage of students of your age have such kind of maturity. It is truly appreciated.
16/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 238 8180: I'm truly grateful for your acknowledgement, Sir. It means a great deal to me to have my efforts recognized by someone as esteemed as yourself.
16/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words.
16/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
16/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 71 238 8180: We have taken note of this Sir, and we are in agreement with the proposed schedule.
16/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 226 1676: To add to Tashinga's response, we hereby assure your good office that Tashinga's participation in all engagements going forward is fully guaranteed. However myself and her mother may fail to participate in some of these future sessions as scheduled due to work commitments. At the same time we will strive that despite the just mentioned we will strive to have one of us or both participate with our daughter in all scheduled future engagements with yourselves.
16/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know about the availabilities of your Mr. Musonza. We have taken a note of it.
16/1/24, 4:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we move forward with our conversation?
16/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes Sir
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday(January 23rd) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
16/1/24, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
16/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes, Sir. That would be great.
16/1/24, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
16/1/24, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Tashinga 2K24JAN0212*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/1/24, 4:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Tashinga EWYL23E1168*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
16/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Everything is clear now Sir.
16/1/24, 5:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
16/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 71 238 8180: One aspect of the Edoofa Scholarship Program that particularly impressed me was its commitment to providing high-quality and cost-effective education. India is renowned for its excellent educational opportunities, and this program truly stood out in that regard. Additionally, the "Earn while you learn" feature greatly appealed to me as it effectively addresses financial constraints. With so many positive aspects to choose from, it is difficult for me to single out just one favorite aspect.
16/1/24, 5:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: EWYL program provides the opportunity for hardworking students to self-finance their higher education on top of the scholarship provided in the Edoofa scholarship program.
This program also assists the students to have a finesse on skills that are prerequisites before venturing into any field and climbing the ladder of success. We are grateful that you are impressed by this program!
16/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes, Sir. Thank you for the insight.
16/1/24, 5:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know, if you have printed the forms that were shared with you?
16/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes Sir, l have printed both forms.
16/1/24, 5:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that! To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
16/1/24, 5:54 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Yes Sir, kindly do so.
16/1/24, 6:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Take note that you will get time to fill out these forms.

17/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Fantastic! Before moving forward, may I get an update on the printed forms that were shared with you, are they completely filled?
17/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 238 8180: I apologize for the inconvenience, but I have not had the opportunity to obtain a passport size photo for the final documentation and my recommendation letter. Could this potentially hinder the commencement of our session?
17/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Tashinga,. Without completely filling out the forms that were shared with you, we can't move forward with the session. I would recommend you to arrange for the passport size photo by today. We will connect tomorrow at 12pm to move forward with our session.
17/1/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Until then please share the screenshot of the online google form as well as the EWYL form.

18/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 71 238 8180: Good morning, Sir. I hope you had a restful night. I would like to seek clarification regarding your mention of "A level results." Is it acceptable if I provide both my A level results for both terms as an alternative to the recommendation letter? Unfortunately, my school currently does not have electricity to facilitate typing or printing of the document.
18/1/24, 12:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tashinga! I hope you are doing well. I have taken note of your concern you may send your A level results for now but also keep in mind that you have to share the recommendation letter as well.

18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: First of all! Thank you for sharing the documents. I have taken note of it and will update in our records as well.
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Noted Sir, we may start our discussion
18/1/24, 12:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
18/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Which image Sir?
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for noticing, there was technical glitch due to which this happened.
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Thank you very much Sir. You may proceed.
18/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 226 1676: It is indeed self-explanatory. Many thanks Sir.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Perfectly clear Sir.
18/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 238 8180: I am following Sir, everything is clear.
18/1/24, 1:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 1:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Quite clear Sir.
18/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 238 8180: This is quite clear Sir, thank you.
18/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. You are most welcome. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Certainly Sir, let us proceed.

19/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Our apology for the abrupt pause in our conversation. We are in 3 different locations and Tashinga is facing serious Internet connectivity where she is. Please accept our sincere apology. Her being the key participator at our ends puts our conversation into threat of continuation?
19/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your concern, @263772261676. I understand the network challenges that Tashinga may be facing on her side. However, it does not mean that we cannot move forward with the session. I just want you to make sure that whenever she has a strong connection, she shares her understanding of the 4 videos. I hope you ar clear ?
19/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Very well stated and clear Sir. Thank you for your sincere consideration. We may go forward nevertheless.
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing! Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Affirmative Sir.
19/1/24, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! Now, it is our responsibility to move Tashinga's application ahead and help Tashinga write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Tashinga's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Tashinga's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
19/1/24, 1:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Tashinga's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

19/1/24, 2:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes, Mr. Musonza!
22/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 238 8180: The summary of the video highlights EDOOFA's far-reaching vision, which goes beyond providing affordable education and ensuring employability through the SEEL program for students. EDOOFA also aims to enhance students' capacity for success, fostering responsibility and independence. This is also achieved through the Earn While You Learn program and the founders made an example of a student named Courage who exceeded their expectations by attaining the highest scholarship credist.The third video emphasizes how EDOOFA has dedicated significant effort to identify quality schools, colleges, and universities for passionate EDOOFA students. The founders encourage students to diligently follow instructions to adequately prepare and qualify for these esteemed institutions. Lastly, the concluding video focuses on the importance of crafting a compelling Statement of Purpose.

22/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 71 238 8180: 2. Rights refer to the entitlements or freedoms that individuals possess, such as the right to freedom of speech or the right to a fair trial. Duties, on the other hand, are the obligations or responsibilities that individuals have towards others or society as a whole. Human rights are inherent to all human beings regardless of nationality, race, religion, or any other status, while civil rights are specific rights granted by law within a particular jurisdiction. In addition to individual rights and duties, there are also collective rights and duties. Collective rights refer to the rights of groups or communities, such as indigenous peoples' rights to self-determination or the right to cultural preservation. These rights emphasize the importance of recognizing and respecting the unique cultural identities and practices of different groups.
Collective duties, on the other hand, refer to the responsibilities that groups or communities have towards each other and towards society. This can include promoting social cohesion, participating in democracy, or contributing to the common good.

3. A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases and is responsible for proving the guilt of the defendant. An attorney is a broader term that encompasses both prosecutors and defense attorneys who represent individuals or entities in legal matters.

4. I am most interested in pursuing Corporate Law because I am fascinated by the complexities of business transactions and corporate governance.

5.As a former Junior Parliamentarian and Junior Advocate, I have gained valuable insight into the legislative process and legal advocacy. This experience has honed my skills in legal research, public speaking, and understanding the intricacies of the law. For example, during my time as a Junior Advocate, I had the opportunity to research and present legal arguments on a variety of issues, which deepened my understanding of the legal system and improved my ability to analyze complex legal matters.

Furthermore, my negotiation skills have been developed through various experiences, such as negotiating compromises and solutions during parliamentary debates and advocating for favorable outcomes for clients as a Junior Advocate. These negotiation skills will be crucial in reaching settlements, mediating disputes, and securing favorable terms for clients in a legal context.
Moreover, my confidence has been bolstered by my experiences in public speaking and legal advocacy. For example, I have confidently presented arguments in parliamentary sessions and courtroom settings, demonstrating composure and conviction in articulating my positions. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 71 238 8180: *4. I choose Corporate Law because l am driven by my fascination with the intricate complexities of business transactions and corporate governance. Moreover, my love for advocating for individuals and their corporate businesses has further fueled my desire to pursue this path. As I closely observe the declining state of justice in Zimbabwe, particularly in relation to corporate governance, I am compelled to choose corporate law as a means to effect positive change within my country. By pursuing this field, I envision myself actively contributing to the restoration of justice and integrity in corporate practices, ultimately making a lasting impact on the business landscape of Zimbabwe.
22/1/24, 3:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Musonza!
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your responses to the documents and the SOP form. I have taken note of these and will update them in our records as well. We have our session right now. May I know if you ar ready to take forward our conversation?
22/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 226 1676: A pleasant good afternoon to you Sir. We are ready to go.
22/1/24, 3:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before moving forward, may I know how are you all doing there?
22/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 226 1676: We are doing very well Sir having started a  new working week on a positive. We are looking forward to a fruitful engagement with you today.
22/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are more than ready and excited this week on a positive note. We are going to have a fruitful conversation today.
22/1/24, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
22/1/24, 3:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
22/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 226 1676: It is indeed accurate Sir.
22/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Affirmative Sir
22/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
22/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
22/1/24, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
22/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 238 8180: Indeed Sir. Kindly enlighten us.
22/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Well articulated Sir.
22/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
22/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
22/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
22/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
22/1/24, 3:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
22/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 226 1676: We strive to have financial stability and your plan above would serve to underpin this.
22/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
22/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 226 1676: If you may please?
22/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
22/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
22/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
22/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 226 1676: We totally agree Sir. We are exploring ways including this one which is key to bridge the gap of $3000. Totally in agreement.
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263772261676, this plan is the most efficient way that we are explaining to you right now. Now, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
22/1/24, 4:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
22/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 226 1676: I can certainly see it yes. We are definitely on the same page Sir.
22/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
22/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
22/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
22/1/24, 5:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
22/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 226 1676: We will save from the USD salaries we both receive. So we need to master your handy concepts as  imparted to us in the above. Sir and we will be good.
22/1/24, 5:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
22/1/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Sounds like a good idea please elucidate to us, Sir?
22/1/24, 5:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
22/1/24, 5:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
22/1/24, 5:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
22/1/24, 5:37 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Yes please. Go ahead.
22/1/24, 5:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes Mr. Musonza, surely! If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
22/1/24, 5:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
22/1/24, 5:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
22/1/24, 5:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
22/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Splendid plan. We do not hesitate to sign up for it..
22/1/24, 5:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that . With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
22/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Quite correct Sir.
22/1/24, 5:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
22/1/24, 5:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
22/1/24, 5:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
22/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Quite okay Sir.
22/1/24, 6:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
22/1/24, 6:09 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Yes I have Sir. I have an existing FBC Mastercard account which has been operation since 2020.So on that aspect Iam already covered, Sir.
22/1/24, 6:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
22/1/24, 6:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: What do you feel about this?
22/1/24, 6:20 PM - +263 77 226 1676: It's in order Sir, quite elaborately crafted I may say. So how soon may we reconnect Sir. I don't anticipate any alternative view from the family.
22/1/24, 6:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are already ready to move forward, but please discuss this with your family once, so that they are aware of this plan. We will reconnect at 4:30PM tomorrow to take ahead our conversation. Till then I wish you a wonderful evening ahead!
22/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 226 1676: Same to you Sir. Very well said.
22/1/24, 9:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words.

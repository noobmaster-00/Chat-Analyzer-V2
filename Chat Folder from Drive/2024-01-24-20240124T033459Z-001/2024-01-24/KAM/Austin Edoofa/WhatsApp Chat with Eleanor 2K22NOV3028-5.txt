This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

8/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eleanor,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 7:40 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Thank you maa my new year have been great
9/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so good to hear, dear.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 77 982 5054: My goal for now is to learn in my Dean country India ❤️
9/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is amazing to hear, Eleanor! I am happy to be here to support you through the process.
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Maam it's because I was waiting to be informed what I was supposed to do next by my mentors by they didn't say it so I thought maybe they shifted it to 2024 bit if there is anything that needs to be done you can kindly inform me maam
9/1/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Eleanor. There must have been some misunderstanding. However, I am relieved that we are connected now to ensure that you can secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your higher education. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the application process right now?
11/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am um ready
11/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. It's good to know that. Shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
11/1/24, 10:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

11/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 982 5054: This is great ma'am
Im a proud edoofian too ma'am ❤️
11/1/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes you are, dear. I am glad to see your enthusiasm.
11/1/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
11/1/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
11/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am that's true🥂
11/1/24, 11:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Definitely dear.
11/1/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I also wanted to share with you a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but during this event, we were fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who presented and shared their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they were there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students presented directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products.

Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Um thrilled to be part of these events ma'am
11/1/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad, Eleanor. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
11/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Um done with them ma'am
11/1/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/1/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
11/1/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.
11/1/24, 12:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Noted ma'am
11/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Ouk ma'am so how do I secure the seat
11/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I will guide you through the process, dear. Do not worry. For now, let us proceed with the session so you don't miss out on important details that I am about to share.
11/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Ouk. Ma'am
11/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes maam
Go onn
11/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
11/1/24, 12:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am
Thank you
11/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 982 5054: No ma'am I'm getting it
Lets move on
11/1/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Plizz provide me with more information ma'am
11/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
11/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
11/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
11/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
11/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am it's very helpful
11/1/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am
11/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am I agree with you
11/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am
11/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
11/1/24, 1:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am
11/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Noted ma'am
11/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 982 5054: No i have no questions
11/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. Are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you enthusiastic about the next steps and receiving your offer letter?
11/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes ma'am
11/1/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move ahead, I believe we asked you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
11/1/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As per my records, you have shared your O-Level results and your ID proof with us. To proceed with your application process, I will need you to share the 1st document as well. Could you please let me know by when you will be able to provide me with that document?
11/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Ouk ma'am the results are not out yet
11/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You can share the Statement of Entry instead of your results, dear.
11/1/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/1/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Or you may also share a Letter of Recommendation from your school authorities. Which out of the 2 will you be able to provide, dear?
11/1/24, 4:42 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Statement of entry
11/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 982 5054: <Media omitted>
13/1/24, 5:49 AM - +263 77 982 5054: Good evening
13/1/24, 6:01 AM - +263 77 982 5054: <Media omitted>
13/1/24, 8:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear. Congratulations! <This message was edited>

13/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 77 982 5054: Thank you ma'am ❤️ thank you so much
13/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we can conclude our discussion and initiate step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College.

If you recall, I am your Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa and hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Hence I request you to come online, notify on this group and continue with your admission procedures.

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.

*Career Options in Sociology*
Sociology, as a career, is both impactful and fulfilling. Many of us have aspired to make an impact on society and the career options in sociology bring this opportunity close.

Here are some of the most popular career options in sociology:

1. Social Worker
A career in helping people and improving societies, which pretty much defines a social worker, is the most sought-after job for sociology aspirants. Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.

2. Journalist
For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.

3. Administrative Support
Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.

4. Rehabilitation Counsellor
If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.

5. Family Counsellor
Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.

6. Survey Researcher
As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.

7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist
A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.

8. Policy Analyst
Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population

9. Media Planner
A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns.
22/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Thank you sir for tge enlightenment
22/1/24, 8:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome, Eleanor!
Do you have any questions for me regarding the course?
22/1/24, 8:53 PM - +263 77 982 5054: No sir for now i don't have sir
22/1/24, 8:53 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Will ask if i have anything to ask
22/1/24, 8:56 PM - Austin Edoofa: Sure, As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
22/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 982 5054: It was said that the registration fee is 750 and when you pay the money it will be subtracted from my fees the first year i will be at the university <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Fhe money is also payed in two months half amount can be in jan and the other in Feb <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 9:10 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am glad you have this understanding, Eleanor!
22/1/24, 9:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: Let me explain further. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
22/1/24, 9:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
22/1/24, 9:11 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Are you clear with the same?*
22/1/24, 9:16 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yes sir its clear
Mive on un listening
22/1/24, 9:20 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great, how are the preparations in your family progressing towards the registration fee and how far have you managed to raise as of now?
22/1/24, 9:46 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Yeah  for now we are ready to pay the half amount of the registration fee
22/1/24, 9:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Eleanor!
So, let me discuss with our Academic Board to speed up the process for you to begin with the University registration process. Meanwhile, if any questions comes up in your mind, do feel free to ask

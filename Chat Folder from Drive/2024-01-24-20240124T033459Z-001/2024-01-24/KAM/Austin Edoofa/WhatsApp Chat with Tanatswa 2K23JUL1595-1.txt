12/1/24, 6:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanatswa,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 12:34 PM - +27 83 470 2027: As requested
17/1/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanatswa.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
22/1/24, 11:32 PM - Austin Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Tanatswa
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *2:00 pm CAT tomorrow* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
23/1/24, 12:17 AM - +27 83 470 2027: Morning
Am seeing the message now
Hope we are not too late
23/1/24, 12:17 AM - +27 83 470 2027: We were a bit discouraged when we 7 points instead of 12 which was the min required
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good Day dear parent and Tanatswa
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Good Afternoon Mr Austin yes we are ready
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: Good to hear from you, Tanatswa!
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: It is alright, Mr Abraham

23/1/24, 2:40 PM - Austin Edoofa: Congratulations on passing in all A level subjects, Tanatswa, At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you are yet to complete the University registration process while you being a bright student and I still remember her passion for career and goals. I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  

So are you actively available to begin the session? <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Thank you Mr Austin
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Yes I am available
23/1/24, 2:58 PM - Austin Edoofa: Great,do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 2:58 PM - Austin Edoofa: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 847 1404: As you have already stated the fee structures of the public universities in Zimbabwe are a bit high per term , so we have been looking forward to hear from Edoofa if the application for a university in India is still available considering the fee structures for universities here in Zimbabwe
23/1/24, 3:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: This is well noted, Tanatswa!
23/1/24, 3:24 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 847 1404: That's so wonderful
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Everyone looks happy
23/1/24, 3:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed Tanatswa!
23/1/24, 3:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:51 PM - Austin Edoofa: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Not giving up and working , maybe you would  care to share with me the reasons
23/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa: Indeed, they are absolute reasons itself
23/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 4:08 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:08 PM - Austin Edoofa: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 4:08 PM - Austin Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 4:08 PM - Austin Edoofa: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
23/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 847 1404: True
23/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Yes am very looking forward to it
23/1/24, 4:29 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is good to hear, Tanatswa!
23/1/24, 4:30 PM - Austin Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Indeed it is accurate Mr Austin
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 4:48 PM - Austin Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Yes am looking forward to it
23/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Yes I do remember but in the last two months I had a change to my whatsapp so if you may kindly share the registration fee with that would be appreciated
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: In that case, Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Austin Edoofa: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Yes nderstood very well
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - +27 83 470 2027: This is clear
23/1/24, 5:26 PM - +27 83 470 2027: But now you bring the reg fee into discussion again of which the impression is it has been waived
23/1/24, 5:26 PM - +27 83 470 2027: Would you be kind to clarify
23/1/24, 5:29 PM - Austin Edoofa: Well Mr Abraham, The registration fee is to be paid by the parent which in usual cases is an addition cost, But, through Edoofa, this registration fee will be considered as a part of the cost of education itself and will be subtracted from the cost of education. The child is supposed to pay only the remaining cost of education after arriving in India
23/1/24, 5:30 PM - +27 83 470 2027: Okay i see its clear Sir
23/1/24, 5:30 PM - +27 83 470 2027: Thank you for being generous
23/1/24, 5:31 PM - +27 83 470 2027: So there are two semesters per year?
23/1/24, 5:32 PM - +27 83 470 2027: Is accomodation available in the mid semester breaks
23/1/24, 5:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: You are most welcome!
23/1/24, 5:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: That is right
23/1/24, 5:39 PM - Austin Edoofa: Yes, students can continue at their Accommodation during breaks or can visit home.
23/1/24, 6:14 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Well noted
23/1/24, 6:53 PM - Austin Edoofa: Alright Tanatswa, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity for you to study in India under the given Scholarship.  Since this is a very important decision for your career being a decision, I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your parent, address concerns if any and finalise the University registration process. Mr Abraham @27834702027 , shall I share the schedule with you?

20/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 470 8728: Ok mam
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Morning
20/1/24, 9:07 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Okay mam
20/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Dear, you have mentioned the EWYL Program date as 28 January and Orientation date as 30 January, may I know why?
20/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 995 1600: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Sorry mam  it's a wrong sheet the correct one is that one
20/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 77 470 8728: On our discussion there was a section where it was written that the EWYL program will start on 30 January 2024 that was the reason choose that date
20/1/24, 9:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Shantel, I believe there has been some confusion. Allow me to help you understand it better. The column "orientation availability" refers to a 3-day window following the commencement of your EWYL program, which, in your case, is on January 30. After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 30 to February 3 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 30, and you are required to input a date between January 30 and February 3 for your Orientation program. It is permissible for both the EWYL Program availability and Orientation availability to share the same date. If you are available for the orientation on January 30 itself, kindly indicate so. I hope that was helpful? <This message was edited>

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/1/24, 9:53 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
20/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 77 995 1600: <Media omitted>

20/1/24, 10:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
20/1/24, 10:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same, dear. I have taken a note of it. <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 77 995 1600: You are welcome mam
20/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Okay
20/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 995 1600: I'm done  mam
20/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/1/24, 10:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
20/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
20/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/1/24, 10:22 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes
20/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Okay mam l have understood
20/1/24, 10:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.

20/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 995 1600: I don't have any queries mam
20/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes
20/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
20/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

23/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Question 2.The difference between  rights and duties

Rights  are referred to as inherent  to us all,regardless  of nationality,sex,national  or ethnic origin ,colour,religion ,language  or any other status ,,are a set of principles  concerned with equality and fairness whereas duties are things one is obligated to do ,or an action or task required by a person's  position or occupation  ,function ,the duties of a clergyman ,the respectful and obedient conduct  due a parent ,superior,elder,a task or chore one is expected to do like it's one's duty to do dishes .Rights are those priviledges  and benefits  a person enjoys  as citizen of a state while duties are the responsibilities which citizens are expected  to carry out.The primary  difference  between rights and duties is that rights is based on priviledge granted to an individual   ,whereas  duty is based on accountability  ,for example  one has the right to a safe clean room,like me l have the right to a safe clean room and leave alone with my friends and family .other rights includes  the rights of a child to be fed ,cooked meal by the mother entails some kind of corresponding due to help set the table or clear it, washes the dishes .Examples of duties are obeying laws,paying taxes,defending the natio  and serving on juries and we must know one is under the law.For example the right to freedom of speech is a right that individuals have, while the duty to obey the law  is  a duty that everyone is obligated to fulfil.Rights are typically  seen as possible freedoms  or the obligation to refrain from doing something  .In some cases ,the distinction  between  rights and duties can be blurred,but in general ,they are two distinct concepts

Rights that shall not be limited are the right to life with the expectation of the death penalty  as provided.The examples are right  to human dignity,not to be tortured,subjected to cruel,inhuman,degrading  treatment  and punishment, right not to be placed in slavery or servitude,right to a fair trial.Fundamental human rights are right to liberty,security, freedom of speech, conscience, religion ,work,education ,movement, privacy ,participate in government  ,equality before the law

23/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Thank you mam
23/1/24, 10:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
23/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
23/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
23/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
23/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes
23/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
23/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
23/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes he has discussed  about  that
23/1/24, 10:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
23/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
23/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
23/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
23/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
23/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 77 995 1600: okay
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
23/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Okay
23/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
23/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Noi
23/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
23/1/24, 11:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
23/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Okay
23/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
23/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
23/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
23/1/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
23/1/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
23/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
23/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, allow me to help yo understand it better. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
23/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 995 1600: Yes mam
23/1/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 995 1600: No mam
23/1/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
23/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 995 1600: I am very excited mam
23/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
23/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Shantel. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
23/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 995 1600: Same to  you mam thanks

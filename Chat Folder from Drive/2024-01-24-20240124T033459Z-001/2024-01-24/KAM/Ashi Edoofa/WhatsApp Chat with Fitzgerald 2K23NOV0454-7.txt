20/12/23, 1:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Will she be able to pick up from where you left?
20/12/23, 9:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: yes she will be able to
20/12/23, 9:23 PM - +263 71 947 7813: That is good news. It had been a while since we maintained our sessions that it got me anxious
20/12/23, 9:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your Erollment Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you.
20/12/23, 9:30 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Please do keep in touch.
26/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fitzgerald ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes I am available
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I had gone through it in my last session. But it was no explained to me yet
26/12/23, 3:11 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I am done
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes they are
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
26/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
26/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
26/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
26/12/23, 3:52 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
26/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/12/23, 4:05 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes please do
26/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/12/23, 4:18 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
26/12/23, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you. I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
26/12/23, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263719477813 I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
26/12/23, 5:14 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Tomorrow morning
26/12/23, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
27/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fitzgerald, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. By now, I assume you have gone through the videos we shared with you, could you please let us know if you have completed the videos ? <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 1:51 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes I have
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I must say they have made believe that Edoofa is more legit than I imagined
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 71 947 7813: It has come to my attention that in the SOP the student must convince Admissions by showing his achievements, unique traits and beig resourceful. They must also be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Processes become faster if student follows instructions.  The Check points find the best institutes for the students  and the SEELS  program makes students employable
27/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 947 7813: It is all clear to me
27/12/23, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Indeed we are.
27/12/23, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
27/12/23, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Okay
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 71 947 7813: By tomorrow at noon I will be done
27/12/23, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
27/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Thank you
27/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263719477813

29/12/23, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, You can share the form with us in the evening when you reach home.
29/12/23, 3:03 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Thank you
29/12/23, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Affirmitive
29/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Everything is correct
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes I do agree
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I understand
29/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/12/23, 3:20 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes he did
29/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes we are.
29/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
29/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 71 947 7813: It is clear
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350 . The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 3:53 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Okau
29/12/23, 3:54 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Okay
29/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 3:55 PM - +263 71 947 7813: That is so convenient
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Everything  is clear
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes indeed
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263719477813 Are we still connected?
29/12/23, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, I was waiting for your response although it seems like you were unavailable. I would love to continue with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
29/12/23, 9:47 PM - +263 71 947 7813: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:48 PM - +263 71 947 7813: This is the form you requested. I hope I wrote it correctly
30/12/23, 12:04 PM - +263 71 505 4041: Agood. morning to you all protocols  observed
30/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fitzgerald, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, Hence, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
30/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Today I am available
30/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 71 947 7813: But the network here is quite bad
30/12/23, 3:14 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Can we move it to 7:00pm
30/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, We can reconnect at 7:00pm
30/12/23, 3:15 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I hope you saw my EWYL form
30/12/23, 3:15 PM - +263 71 947 7813: This form
30/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263719477813
30/12/23, 6:44 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Good day. I am ready for the session
30/12/23, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
30/12/23, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
30/12/23, 6:48 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Thank you so much
30/12/23, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263719477813, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
30/12/23, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/12/23, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
30/12/23, 6:51 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I have reviewed the benefits
30/12/23, 6:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/12/23, 6:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/12/23, 6:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 71 947 7813: That is wonderful news
30/12/23, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/12/23, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/12/23, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes indeed
30/12/23, 7:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
30/12/23, 7:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/12/23, 7:02 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
30/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/12/23, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/12/23, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/12/23, 7:07 PM - +263 71 947 7813: It is quite clear
30/12/23, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/12/23, 7:11 PM - +263 71 947 7813: So far everything is clear
30/12/23, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/12/23, 7:11 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes I am
30/12/23, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
30/12/23, 7:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
30/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 71 947 7813: That is okay
30/12/23, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you all a Happy New Year. May it be filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.
30/12/23, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 7:16 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Same to you
30/12/23, 7:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263719477813

I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (5-Jan-2024).

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 06:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

9/1/24, 10:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 8:01 AM - +263 71 947 7813: I would like to personally thank you for this breakthrough. You have changed my life for the better.
10/1/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fitzgerald ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
10/1/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
10/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes I have had the chance
10/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263719477813 . As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
10/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
10/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
10/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
10/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 71 947 7813: 1. $350
2. $0
3.$575 
4.$125
5.$1000
10/1/24, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details, although your annual fee is $1600. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
10/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes and what about food?
10/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Can you explain to me on paying the registration fee and visa application?
10/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263719477813 Kindly don't worry as I will be attending all your queries at the end of our discussion please.
10/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
10/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
10/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes it does
10/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
10/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I am done
10/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
10/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
10/1/24, 7:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263719477813 May I know if we are still connected ?
10/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
10/1/24, 8:53 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes it is clear
10/1/24, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
10/1/24, 8:59 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes
10/1/24, 8:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 23rd, 2024*.
10/1/24, 9:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/1/24, 9:04 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes. Please do
10/1/24, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 23rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 23rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
10/1/24, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/1/24, 9:07 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes we are
10/1/24, 9:08 PM - +263 71 947 7813: I must thank you for making things much flexible and easier
10/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/1/24, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/1/24, 9:16 PM - +263 71 947 7813: No. I am in Gokwe
10/1/24, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/1/24, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/1/24, 9:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/1/24, 9:17 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Okay
10/1/24, 9:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
10/1/24, 9:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
10/1/24, 9:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
10/1/24, 9:45 PM - +263 71 947 7813: Yes you can. It will be much easier
10/1/24, 9:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
10/1/24, 10:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, As I was looking forward for your response, I want to share that my working hours are over. Hence, I would like to schedule our session with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Please confirm if this time is convenient for you. In the event that you are unavailable at this specific time, kindly provide your availability between 2:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and we can coordinate to schedule our session accordingly.

11/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fitzgerald, Wishing you a good day!
11/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to our conversation yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?

11/1/24, 7:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, I just wanted to share the university insights with you -

15/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 947 7813: We were interested in knowing if Mr Shorwi can do the transaction with 7% rate as Mr Rajan does.
15/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 947 7813: They were really excited and shocked with the offer of the university but also agitated if they could meet up with the dead lines in time.
15/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Let me assist you with your first query about the charges rate. I would like to share that when you make the payment through Mr. Rajan in the form of cash in that case the local charges are neglected. However, When you make the payment through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Account, the charges are needed for the transfer rate. Hence the charges will be same if you are planning to pay through Mr. Shorwi.

15/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 947 7813: According to them the money might not be  enough yet before the due date but they have their fingers crossed hoping to come up with something
15/1/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, May I know the reason due to which they are not sure about the amount ?

30/12/23, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Naome ,

11/1/24, 11:49 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing fine, I am doing well dear thank you
11/1/24, 11:49 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to your last conversation with Mr. Shivjeet, I want to understand if you remember the procedure dear ?
11/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 77 833 3769: You are welcome
11/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 833 3769: I remember finishing my l classes with him m and I was now doing them with Ms Saloni Rastogi
11/1/24, 11:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263778333769, For the clear understanding, I want to know if you remember your cost of education and the registration cost, Could you please confirm ?
11/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 833 3769: Mmm I don't remember the exact figures but I will confirm with my parents
11/1/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, If you want then I can share them with you again to understand the procedure better, Shall we proceed?
11/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes we can
11/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Computer Science)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes it's accurate sir
11/1/24, 12:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/1/24, 12:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/1/24, 12:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/1/24, 12:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes I'm sure of that
11/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 833 3769: I understand all
11/1/24, 12:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes we discussed about it all
11/1/24, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes we on the same page
11/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
11/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes yes
11/1/24, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/1/24, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Ok all noted
11/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes I understand the EWYL program
11/1/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 833 3769: No I don't have any we can move forward
11/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
11/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

11/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Noted
11/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Woow
11/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Naome. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
11/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Noted
11/1/24, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes we can proceed with it
11/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Alright noted
11/1/24, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/1/24, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/1/24, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/1/24, 6:40 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes sure it does
11/1/24, 6:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know dear if you are occupied some where else as we have been experiencing delays from your side ?
11/1/24, 7:27 PM - +263 77 833 3769: No I'm not occupied it's that my network can be slow at times
11/1/24, 7:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have the stable network now ?
11/1/24, 7:31 PM - +263 77 833 3769: We can try to continue at the moment
11/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263778333769
11/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
11/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/1/24, 7:40 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Alright
11/1/24, 7:41 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes it does
11/1/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/1/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/1/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $325 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/1/24, 7:49 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Ok
11/1/24, 7:50 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Ok ok
11/1/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 833 3769: No it's all clear😇
11/1/24, 7:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 77 833 3769: No
11/1/24, 7:57 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Can we proceed with the he remaining
11/1/24, 7:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
11/1/24, 7:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
11/1/24, 7:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
11/1/24, 7:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
11/1/24, 8:03 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Ok ok I get it
11/1/24, 8:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/1/24, 8:05 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes
11/1/24, 8:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes I agree with you
11/1/24, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
11/1/24, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/1/24, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes
11/1/24, 8:11 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Ohhh yeah I am
11/1/24, 8:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 8:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

16/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Good afternoon
16/1/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Yes im sure that approach works the best <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 505 2139: *The per  semester fee after the scholarship is $900

*The course duration is 3 years which is 6 semesters

*The Adimission fee is $300

*The Registration fee is $750
16/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 833 3769: 1. 900USD
2. 3 years(6 semesters)
3. 300USD
4. 750 USD
16/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Yes this one is clear
16/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 505 2139: How long is each semester?
16/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that the duration of each semester is around 4 - 5 months please. I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Noted
16/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Got it
16/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Is the the off campus accomodation also run or administered by the University?
16/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes it does
16/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that the off-campus accommodation is not run by the university although the university will assist you in looking for off-campus accommodation
16/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Thank you
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Clear on this one
16/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes sure
16/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 28th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Yes we are togather
16/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes we are
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Kindly explain , thank you
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 28th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Thank you for the clarification. We may proceed when you are ready
16/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are truly welcome @263775052139. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 505 2139: We reside in mutare but Naome is currently in Harare.
16/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Thank you for sharing the contact number
16/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Thank you
16/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 505 2139: We will opt to make the payment through Mr Rajan as the charges are reasonably low
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263775052139, If you need Mr. Shorwi's details in future please do let me know. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Thank you
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 505 2139: On point (1) isnt it going to be $900
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Ooh ok i get now, its clear
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes understood
16/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Is $800 the minium or  this is just  a common range
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263775052139 The amount which student can earn has no limits please
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Noted
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 505 2139: Thank you for explaining everything  clearly,  You may proceed when you are ready.
16/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 833 3769: Yes we can proceed

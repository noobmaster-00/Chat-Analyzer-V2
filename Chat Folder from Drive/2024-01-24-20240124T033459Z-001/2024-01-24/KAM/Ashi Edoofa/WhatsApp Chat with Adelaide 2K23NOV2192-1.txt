18/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon everyone
18/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Adelaide,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/1/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Good afternoon Miss Ashi. My days of waiting were worrisome that I might not make it
18/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Mom and I have gone through it
18/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through the letter. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 653 1903: It's perfect. Looking forward to it
18/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
18/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 653 1903: That's alright
18/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please share your response with us
18/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 653 1903: 1. $1225
2. 4 years
3. $200
4. $700
18/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 653 1903: I have
18/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Very
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
18/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Is there a transport component if I'm to choose option 2 or the LPU campus is within walking distance
18/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 218 8531: Good afternoon everyone. 

I am very grateful for the offer for my daughter to study in India. Thank you for making her dream come true
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The accommodations are situated near the university. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month.
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
18/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
18/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Question. You said I can visit the campus and select the room I want. Where will I stay before I make this selection
18/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Clear
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Kindly confirm that the scholarship pays 50% of tuition only
18/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786531903 The offer letter is shared by the university includes the scholarship percentage which is 50%
18/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Of tuition or both tuition and accomodation
18/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786531903 The scholarship percentage which is given to you is after scholarship which covers your total cost of education. If you want me to explain further, I will be more than happy to do so
18/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 218 8531: Please do explain further
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I will be more than happy to elaborate dear, I hope you remember that the cost of education shared for your Higher Education is $2700 - $3700. According to the offer letter shared by the LPU University, The per annum  tuition fee is $2450 and the cost of accommodation (off-campus) is $1000. When you add both of these cost the total cost of your education is $3450 which falls under the same range shared with you, right ?
18/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 5:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 31st, 2024*.
18/1/24, 5:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Please do
18/1/24, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 31st, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/1/24, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 31st, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 5:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/1/24, 5:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 5:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/1/24, 5:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/1/24, 5:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/1/24, 6:01 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Alright thank you
18/1/24, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/1/24, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr, Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/1/24, 6:10 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes. Just for comparison
18/1/24, 6:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/1/24, 6:15 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Sorry. Question here. When is the $200 for Admission processing due?
18/1/24, 6:19 PM - +263 78 653 1903: I have also noted with concern that my late father is listed as my guardian. From the onset we've always noted that he's deceased and are therefore requesting that his name be replaced with my mother's as she is the only living parent
18/1/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that the admission and processing fee of $200, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/1/24, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding this I will inform the university please don't worry
18/1/24, 6:32 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Thank you
18/1/24, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/1/24, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes
18/1/24, 6:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/1/24, 6:39 PM - +263 78 653 1903: I do. What do you recommend as the best option for accomodation
18/1/24, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that a lot of students prefers off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
18/1/24, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
18/1/24, 6:47 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Yes. Thank you
18/1/24, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
18/1/24, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
18/1/24, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

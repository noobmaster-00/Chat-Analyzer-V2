9/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Benjamin ,

I hope you are doing well. I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee by 16th January, 2024. 

Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far. Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
9/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Yes it's true madam how are you we are going to be to pay it Thank you for reminding us

16/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Thank you
17/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Benjamin,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *LPU  University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
17/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 1:00 PM to 04:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
17/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 7:53 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Thank you so much madam. I am Benjamin.s mom at this present moment I'm a bit far away from Benjamin bt tomorrow by 7 o'clock am I will be with him. Once again thank you for the effort as well as your precious time he will be available at 1o.clock pm
17/1/24, 7:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263776878739. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 1:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete LPU University admission formalities.

For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 7:57 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Thank you ma'am
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Benjamin,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Sure sir
18/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes
18/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
18/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 562 2820: 1)$975
2)3years
3)$200
4)$700
18/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
18/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes sir
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 562 2820: I am following
18/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 562 2820: But sir is it possible for me to pay the registration fee in two phases
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, I will share the payment plan with you soon.
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Ok sir thank you
18/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes
18/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 31st, 2024*.
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Sure
18/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 31st , 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 31st, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 562 2820: What if I didn't get $100grant will I still be able to pay the fee in installments
18/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes
18/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, You already have the grant which is why your registration fees is $600 not $700
18/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Ohh ok sir
18/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes I live in Harare
18/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Thanks for sharing
18/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Well noted
18/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Great
18/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes sir
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Well I am clear
18/1/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
18/1/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
18/1/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

18/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Thank you for sharing
18/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome,  Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
18/1/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realising your dream of pursuing education abroad.
18/1/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday at 01:00 pm. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
18/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Yes sir
18/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
18/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 562 2820: Thank you 
Same applies
18/1/24, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear!
22/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Good day sir
22/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Benjamin !

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by LPU University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from LPU University as a collective?
22/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Yes sir as a family we had an opportunity to review the offer letter and had this to say
22/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 687 8739: We have seen that according to the way we got our finances this University is too expensive for us and we are pleading with you if you can give us other aUniversities which have accepted our child so that we can compare we don't want to lose this chance and we don't have to fail him after failing to secure finance as time goes on
22/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, I appreciate your honesty here. As you are feeling that the university is too expensive for you, May I kindly know why are you feeling the same  ?
22/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Looking at how the campus is and it's rental fees we have come to the conclusion that we won't afford the University that why we are pleading with you to send some other Universities besides this one and compare
22/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before I answer you concern here, I would like to know if you had the opportunity to search about the LPU University ?
22/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 687 8739: We just read the offer letter we didn't search more about LPU University
22/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem @263776878739, I want to share that LPU University is one of the top University in India. I would like to encourage you to first search about the university  Due to the outstanding performance of the university, There are limited number of seats at LPU University which has created a competitive environment, and hence students from all corners of the globe are striving to secure admission over there. Benjamin is one of the fortunate students to have secured this prestigious scholarship.
22/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, I would like to inquire if you are aware of how Benjamin was able to secure such a prestigious offer and how his admission process has been carried out?
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 687 8739: I'm no aware sir can you please share with us how as a parent may be I have missed some of the aspects because today I'm in town tomorrow I will be at our rural area
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem @263776878739, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
22/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the LPU University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 687 8739: Noted sir
22/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by LPU, you would lose out on the scholarship from LPU  and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
22/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 687 8739: I'm not aware
22/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with LPU by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at LPU without risking losing out on the scholarship.
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $700 to LPU  to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $700.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $700, but because you would have already paid $700 for LPU, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $700 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?

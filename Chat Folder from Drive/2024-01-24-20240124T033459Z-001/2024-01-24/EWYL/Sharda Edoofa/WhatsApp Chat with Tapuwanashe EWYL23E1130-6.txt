Excited for our session! Let's kick things off with this quote:

"Every artist was first an amateur." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

It's a reminder that growth is a journey, and even masters started as beginners. Ready to dive in and explore how this applies to our work together.

To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms

For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
23/1/24, 9:00 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

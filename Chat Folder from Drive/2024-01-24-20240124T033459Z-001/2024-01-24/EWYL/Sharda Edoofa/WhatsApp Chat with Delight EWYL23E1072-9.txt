I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments.

15/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 77 302 5297: Good morning
15/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Morning, we are fine
15/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know that.
15/1/24, 8:38 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Am not quite sure
15/1/24, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Delight* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
15/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Understood
15/1/24, 9:13 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

18/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
18/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
18/1/24, 9:26 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.🥳
18/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 395 8654: Yes it's clear
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
19/1/24, 6:13 AM - +263 78 395 8654: 1. The three projects are;  Corporate Alliances
Community building,
African Schools Education Reform Mission.
2.What do you understand from project 1.
Project 1 is Corporate Alliances whereby a student is assigned to learn practically to interact with companies/ stakeholders in his/ her country  and connect them to the manager of Edoofa, by involving video call, and signing of contracts using online information. The student must identify a company which is within Africa or his/her continent then follow the activities online using LinkedIn account to connect and collect the needed information until they reach an agreement of contract signing which link the stakeholders and the Edoofa manager. By completing this process, the student earn Scholarship credits.
2: My understanding from project 2 which is Community building is that the project is about advertising the goodness of Edoofa Educational ecosystem to young age groups who have just graduated from senior Secondary school recently within 6 months or who are yet to finish their senior Secondary school education to be part of the Edoofa program, so that they can fulfil their dreams and understand the developing of an organization which is based on growing by creating social impact. When you complete this stage that's when certain amounts of Scholarship credits are offered. 
3: Project 3 which is African Schools Education Reform Mission is when a student is directed to reach local senior Secondary schools and facilitate decision makers to connect with Edoofa.
The main aim of Edoofa being connected to the decision makers is to transform and share world class technology and improve African Education.
They will share career counseling, courses and Scholarship opportunities . When identifying Schools, your School must be the first listed. The student will be identified through LinkedIn account. Also after completing this you can earn Scholarship credits.

23/1/24, 9:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
23/1/24, 9:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

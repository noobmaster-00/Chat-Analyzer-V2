I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us!

As we embark on our session today, I'd like to share an inspiring quote that resonates deeply with our journey:

*"Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it."*

This profound wisdom reminds us that while we may encounter various challenges, our power lies in how we respond and navigate through them. It's a testament to the resilience within each of us, shaping not just the path we walk but also the person we become.
18/1/24, 8:37 AM - +27 67 804 4619: Good morning
18/1/24, 8:42 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Let us carry forward our discussion exactly from the place we left off yesterday.
18/1/24, 8:44 AM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay
18/1/24, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Second and the fun part- I’m sure you have read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*

18/1/24, 8:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
18/1/24, 9:01 AM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay
I already have an Instagram account which Is for personal use.
Does that mean I'll have to create a new one?
18/1/24, 9:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, sure. You can do that as well.
18/1/24, 9:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
18/1/24, 9:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-*

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

19/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
19/1/24, 11:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not

While I am sorry to know about this. I would want you guys to shed some more light on this so that I as a mentor am able to understand the situation better. Also, have you informed your admission officer regarding the same?

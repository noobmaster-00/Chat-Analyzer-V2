Yes
2/1/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
2/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 418 5330: The other participant is my Father 
Mr Chitungo
2/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am pleased to meet him and I extend a warm welcome to him for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey✨
2/1/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
2/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 71 418 5330: My long term terms goals include obtaining a degree and futher pursue for a masters in my line of study and I think EWYL program will help me by being able to contribute greatly to my university fees and being able to pursue my education without financial burden
2/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an impressive set of goals!  Obtaining a degree and pursuing a master's in your field is a fantastic aspiration.  The EWYL program is indeed an excellent opportunity to alleviate financial concerns and empower you to focus on your education.
2/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 418 5330: No
2/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday.

2/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs,* showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days.

11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 418 5330: I understood that when searching for companies we should consider the following 

1.Nature of company 
2.Scale of company 
3.Financial stability 
4.Background of founder 

The above points should be adhered to when looking for a company so that I can get the right one 

And I can use the following platforms to look for the right company : Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Inc4media, Internshala(or
  any other internship providing sources), Social media pages( Facebook, Instagram.

20/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Noted
20/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TINASHE/ADITI* <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

22/1/24, 8:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!✨
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
22/1/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
22/1/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/1/24, 8:51 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

17/1/24, 6:24 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Dear Mentor, My name is Davie Nyanja, and my EWYL group name is Davie  EWYL23E1086. I am excited to begin my Ewyl journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 19/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.
19/1/24, 4:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Davie, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
19/1/24, 4:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
19/1/24, 4:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 4:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session Monday onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
19/1/24, 4:46 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Hello Ms. Aditi, I'm doing well and you madam?
19/1/24, 4:46 PM - +27 78 760 0842: Well noted.

22/1/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!✨
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?
22/1/24, 8:43 AM - +27 78 760 0842: I am doing well indeed, and you, how are you doing, and how is India?
22/1/24, 8:44 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes I am.
22/1/24, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well, and everything is going great Davie.
22/1/24, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - +27 78 760 0842: I am Harrison,  Davie Nyanja, order brother, and my sister Sala as well as my uncle Albert Ngwira. Davie is doing grade 12, and he is at school boarding . He is only expected to be with us in September.
22/1/24, 8:49 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Therefore I am going to fill for the period now.
22/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Harrison!
It's a pleasure to learn more about your family members. I hope Davie's academic journey is both fulfilling and successful.
22/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/1/24, 8:54 AM - +27 78 760 0842: I am curious to learn those objectives.
22/1/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Davie* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
22/1/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/1/24, 8:58 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Wonderful and well explained
22/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that Davie achieves the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all the efforts.
22/1/24, 9:01 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Am glad to know and kin to learn from them.
22/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Davie* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week the student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
22/1/24, 9:20 AM - +27 78 760 0842: It is amazing only that as I said Davie is in boarding school where he is prohibited from cellular phones and all other devices. Therefore, all the information will only be relayed to him after a while.
22/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, I am aware of that.
22/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Davie* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up for today and look forward to connecting tomorrow with the same enthusiasm.🌺
22/1/24, 9:34 AM - +27 78 760 0842: alright , I have read it partially, and it's amazing to learn from the founders himself.
22/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/1/24, 8:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's session🚀
23/1/24, 8:36 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Good morning, I am doing well and you,how are you doing and how is India?
23/1/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
I am doing well and India is great!
23/1/24, 8:42 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Great.
23/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
23/1/24, 8:56 AM - +27 78 760 0842: It sounds great.
23/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Davie* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
23/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:02 AM - +27 78 760 0842: I have seen the documents and I can't read as I am working also but if we can just then I will read it at my full time it might be good for me.
23/1/24, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure!
23/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Davie* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Davie* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make the mentor trust the student fully
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Alright madam.
23/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Davie has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
23/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.

The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where he learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
23/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: After that, he was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
23/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, he will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help him to fund his higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build his personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.

Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
23/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Yes we are.
23/1/24, 9:24 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Davie's involvement in the EWYL program can bring him closer to reaching his career goals.

May I know when will he resume his EWYL Process and on which date?
23/1/24, 9:27 AM - +27 78 760 0842: Davie will be available from the end   of July or early August.
23/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
23/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with him and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
23/1/24, 9:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: As per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.

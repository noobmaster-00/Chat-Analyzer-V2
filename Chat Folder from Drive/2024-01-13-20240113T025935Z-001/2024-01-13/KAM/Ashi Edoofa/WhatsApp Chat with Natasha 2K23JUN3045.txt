2. Mama Money - If you are planning to make the payment in Rands, that can be done using Mama Money. The transfer charges for the same mode is zero percentage and hence this is the most feasible mode in case one plans to make the payment from South Africa. For this mode, we will share a Mama Money Order and using the reference id mentioned in the same, you will be able to make the deposit in cash at any of the Mama Money stores in your locality

4/1/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Yes I am ready
5/1/24, 1:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 626 6679: I am done
5/1/24, 1:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 1:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Yes they are
5/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Yes I am following
5/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

5/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

6/1/24, 2:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I shall wait for your response for the remaining videos?

And Edoofa, from what I learnt from the video doesn't only make my academic dreams a reality through affordable standards but is more focussed on improving my capacity for success as a student in such a way it makes me a responsible and independent person.

Pardon me please i will be using my father's phone for now since it has better network reception
8/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 244 5652: From this video I have come to an understanding that the co-founders of Edoofa are considering us, students as their own children.

10/1/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
10/1/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
10/1/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
10/1/24, 1:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
10/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Okay Ma'am thank you for expanding my views on these videos
10/1/24, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
10/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 626 6679: Yes we are Ms Kirti
10/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
10/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

3. A valve is a device that controls the flow of a fluid or gas
A butterfly valve is a type of valve that controls the flow of fluid by rotating a disk or butterfly that is located within the valve body.
Butterfly valves are commonly used in plumbing and industrial applications. They are often usef in Applications where high flow rates are required and where space is limited.

4. Heat treatment is a process used to alter the physical and sometimes the chemical properties of a material by exposing it to high temperatures for a specific period of time.
In some cases heat treatment is used to relieve internal stresses in a material, or to make it more resistant to corrosion. In other cases it is used to change the gain structure of a metal making it more resistant to wear and tear.

5.  Compressors are machines that increase the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume.
There are a variety of types of compressors including centrifugal compressors, axial compressors reciprocating compressors, and scroll compressors.
In gas turbines, centrifugal compressors are often used to compress air before it enters the combustion chamber. These compressors are efficient and can handle large volumes of air.
Axial compressors are often sometimes used in gas turbines though they are less efficient than centrifugal compressors but they are better at compressing  air at high pressures

10/1/24, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
10/1/24, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
10/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
10/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Done
10/1/24, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
10/1/24, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
10/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Following
10/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 441 5087: So it's more like I cnt choose the university I want but I just wait to be told to which one selected me right?
10/1/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263774415087 let me help you understand we will be sharing your application with multiple universities and assist you in understanding the universities and then you can decide which university suits your preference the best, may I know if you are clear now?
10/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes ma'am
10/1/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL). <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
10/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
10/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Plse confirm the amount mentioned here is part of the tution fees
10/1/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero. 

I hope we are clear here?
10/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Clear
10/1/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
10/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Im still here
10/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
10/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
10/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

10/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Please go ahead
10/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
10/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

10/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
10/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
10/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

Student need to be quick and open minded so that they get the best help. Also we have to understand the importance of SOPs. I got opened up that l must not hide anything.

I also got to know that a student can get 100% scholarship especial if the student is sharp and cooperative. Lastly it was stressed tht we need to follow instruction.

Having said the above, it is of high interest tht we wish our daughter is accepted in the best university. We also request if possible to offer Chantell a 100% scholarship that is if she scored good points on her A level exams.

11/1/24, 12:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chantell.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the academic documents it is well noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Good afternoon how are you doing
11/1/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing good. I was just going through your father's understanding of the videos. Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
11/1/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/1/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/1/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Good afternoon, lm here  and ready
11/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Understood
11/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Thank you
11/1/24, 12:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes we are
11/1/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
11/1/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"

11/1/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is good to know that, have a blessed day ahead and do convey my regards to your parents as well.

11/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 441 5087: 2.Rights and duties are fundamental concepts in the realm of ethics, law, and governance. Rights refer to the entitlements or freedoms that individuals possess, which are typically protected and upheld by laws and societal norms. These can include the right to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness, among others. Duties, on the other hand, are the moral or legal obligations that individuals have towards others or towards society as a whole. These obligations often stem from the recognition of the rights of others and the need to maintain order and harmony within a community.

The difference between rights and duties lies in their nature and direction. Rights are focused on the individual, emphasizing what one is entitled to receive or to do, while duties are focused on the individual's responsibilities towards others or towards the community. In essence, rights are about what one is owed or permitted, while duties are about what one owes or is obligated to fulfill.

When it comes to human rights and civil rights, the distinction lies in the scope and application of these rights. Human rights are universal rights that are inherent to all human beings, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, religion, or any other status. They are often viewed as inalienable and are enshrined in international law and conventions. Human rights encompass a broad range of entitlements, including the right to life, freedom from torture, freedom of speech, and the right to education, among others.

On the other hand, civil rights are rights that are specific to a particular society or nation and are granted to its citizens or residents. These rights are often outlined in a country's constitution or legal framework and pertain to the protection of individuals from discrimination and the guarantee of equal treatment under the law. Civil rights can include the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, and the right to freedom of assembly, among others.

In summary, while both human rights and civil rights are aimed at safeguarding and promoting the well-being and freedoms of individuals, human rights have a universal scope and are applicable to all human beings, whereas civil rights are specific to the legal and social context of a particular country or community.
11/1/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 441 5087: 3.The main difference between a prosecutor and an attorney lies in their roles within the legal system. A prosecutor, also known as a district attorney or state's attorney, is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their primary responsibility is to bring charges against individuals or entities accused of violating the law and to present the case against the defendant in court.

On the other hand, an attorney, also referred to as a lawyer, is a broader term that encompasses various legal professionals who provide legal representation and advice to individuals, businesses, or organizations. Attorneys may work in different areas of the law, such as civil litigation, family law, corporate law, or estate planning, and they can represent clients in both criminal and civil cases.

In summary, while a prosecutor specifically represents the government in criminal cases and seeks to prove the guilt of the accused, an attorney is a more general term for a legal professional who provides legal services and representation across a wide range of practice areas and client needs.

11/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 441 5087: This message was deleted
11/1/24, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form and the academic interview questions, I shall wait for your response to the remaining questions.
12/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 441 5087: 4.Several compelling factors have pushed me as an individual to want to study criminal law.Firstly l have a strong desire to seek justice and ensure that the rights of individuals are protected and that serves as a significant motivating factor. The opportunity to advocate for victims of crime and work towards holding perpetrators accountable is also a powerful driving force for my interest in criminal law.I have the desire to make a tangible impact on society by addressing issues such as wrongful convictions, systematic injustice moreso I would like to have an opportunity to work closely with law enforcement agencies, forensic experts,and other legal professionals   last but not least the desire to contribute to a safer and more jst society, coupled with the intellectual and practical challenges presented made me choose criminal law lastly the complexity of criminal cases,the need for thorough investigation and the opportunity to engage in courtroom litigation is intellectual why I chose criminal law
12/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 441 5087: 5.Growing up, I have always been passionate about becoming a lawyer, and I was convinced that I can make it in this field. My goal has remained steadfast, and it has been the driving force behind achieving my lifelong dream of being a lawyer. To be a highly successful lawyer, several key skills are essential. Firstly, I believe I possess exceptional communication skills. Additionally, I have strong analytical and critical thinking skills, as well as problem-solving abilities.

Furthermore, I am confident in my excellent research skills. Moreover, the ability to negotiate skillfully, mediate disputes, and advocate on behalf of people requires strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, which I believe I possess.

Additionally, I am adept at managing high-pressure situations effectively. 

Finally, effective time management, organization, and the ability to work collaboratively in a team. I have served as a prefect at school, representing other students and advocating for them when they were mistreated by others or by teachers. I believe these qualities will contribute to my success as a lawyer.

12/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chantell.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
12/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
12/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BA LLB for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
12/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
12/1/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation before we move ahead I would like to know if you were able to connect with you EWYL mentor by now?
12/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 441 5087: No noone responded
12/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share the screenshot of the message you shared?
12/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 441 5087: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Good afternoon. We all did but there was no activity in the group upto now
12/1/24, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot, I have shared the same with the EWYL team, once I get an update I shall notify you in the meantime may I know if you are ready to start with our discussion?
12/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
12/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
12/1/24, 1:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/1/24, 1:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/1/24, 1:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/1/24, 1:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Yes it's not possible
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Correct
12/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Following
12/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Yes
12/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Im sorry l ddnt understand your example
12/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 294 4709: What is miscellaneous fees and what is registration fees
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772944709 miscellaneous fees are basically sports fees, uniform fees, etc.
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Registration fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Is there any other extra costs in a period of one year that is not the $1200-$1800 fees and the 350 registration fees.
12/1/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be within the first three days of your arrival in India.
12/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 294 4709: For avoidace of doubt are you saying the full payment will be $1350 per year. If there are any other cost after $1350 can l know then now so tht l do not get confused
12/1/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/1/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/1/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Im sorry this was not answered clearly, l need to understand the totol payment that lm expected to pay in one year. The overal total in one year. I request that this be made clear so tht we get prepared
12/1/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772944709 let me help you understand along with this amount, you will be required to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. The average flight expenses from Zimbabwe to India will be $400-$500 and visa fee will be $83.
12/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 294 4709: This l know but l need to know the total amount that we are going to pay in fees and other relates fees in a year
12/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, let me help you understand it. I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case I would have told you the exact fees the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $1200-$1800 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, and after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
12/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now every parent has a question: why are they not told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly? I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University. Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
12/1/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now it is obvious that every university evaluates a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student get to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
12/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 294 4709: Is there any remaining annual fees after paying between $1200-$1800

Are we paying the university seperately or the $1200-$1800 is the university fees
12/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 441 5087: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is __Ms Ananya_______ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___1:30-2:30pm_____" <This message was edited>

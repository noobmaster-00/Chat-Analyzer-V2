28/12/23, 6:31 AM - +263 77 220 3591: Long time Admission, we went for the funeral and after that we also visited our plot and we only came back yesterday in Mutare and in terms of network connectivity the area has no access to it. I am glad to hear that you are very much concerned about our situation and your efforts.
28/12/23, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well. It is alright please, I completely understand what you have been going through and that you might be out of network to respond. However, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and comfortable to move ahead with the discussion?
28/12/23, 6:55 PM - +263 77 220 3591: Go ahead
28/12/23, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now I completely understand your situation here, and the challenges you are going through, however, coming back to Geilen's registration fee I can understand that raising $856 will not be possible for you right now hence, so I would like to know what plan do you have in mind for Geilen's registration fee?
28/12/23, 7:18 PM - +263 77 220 3591: I am yet to get in touch with my bank manager to get an update of the loan deposit.
28/12/23, 7:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that however, as you know the universities are closing the round of applications for the students whose second deadlines were in December on the 31st of December 2023, and for you to not lose on your endowment benefits, I would suggest you please make a deposit of $150 by 30th of December, so that I can have a discussion with the academic board to extend your extension for the remaining part of the fees. May I know if this sounds acceptable to you?
29/12/23, 7:47 AM - +263 77 220 3591: Let me try to make an effort
29/12/23, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Geilen.

29/12/23, 7:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772203591 in that case, may I know if you were able to connect with the bank and if you have any update to share with us regarding that?

31/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 220 3591: I engaged the bank branch manager and he indicated that the bank has a backlog in the disbursement of funds for loan applications but he assured that once the treasury avails funding he will give my case a special priority.
2/1/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Thank you for taking the initiative to speak with the bank branch manager and for providing this update. It's reassuring to know that despite the current backlog in processing loan applications, the manager has committed to prioritizing your case once the necessary funding becomes available. This commitment from the bank is a positive step. However, may I know what timeline did the bank gave to you?
2/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

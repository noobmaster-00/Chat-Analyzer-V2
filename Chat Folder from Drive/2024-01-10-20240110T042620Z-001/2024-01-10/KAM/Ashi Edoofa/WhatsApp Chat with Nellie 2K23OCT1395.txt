20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 1:45 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Good bye
Thank you for everything

And all the best
26/12/23, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nellie ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:52 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Good afternoon

Yes am ready
26/12/23, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @265993652542. Before we start our session, May I know if you remember the benefit shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
26/12/23, 4:16 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes I do
26/12/23, 4:20 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: A reminder please on the benefits please and good afternoon miss Ashi.
I'm Nellie's dad.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, Let's start from the beginning.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 4:49 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Thanks very much we can now proceed.
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @265881351489, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/12/23, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I was looking forward for your response. I am scheduling our session for tomorrow at 2:00 pm. I hope you will be available for the session.
26/12/23, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nellie, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With reference to our yesterday conversation, you left the conversation in between. However, I am eager to know if you are ready for today's session, Could you please share your response with us?
27/12/23, 2:06 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: We just followed on the reminder on the benefits and we were well updated and I propose that you may continue from where you stopped yesterday and we will be following,no questions at the moment as from me just waiting for the university selection list updates.Thank you.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @265881351489, Let's continue with the second benefit please.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: This is noted.
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
27/12/23, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Noted as well
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/12/23, 2:20 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: May be the school list and do the fees comparison.
27/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265881351489 I understand your question however I would like to share that this is not possible as there 250+ universities which we are associated with however, I would like to mention that you will be given the opportunity to do the same when you will receive the offer letter from multiple university. I hope you understand?
27/12/23, 2:33 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: I understand and we will be waiting but wanted to see if we can have ample to prepare from our side as well.
27/12/23, 2:33 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Time.
27/12/23, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @265881351489. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/12/23, 2:39 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Please give me an insight.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/12/23, 2:44 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Cleared now but on our case which category are we I mean basing on Nellie's previous undertaking performance?.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265881351489 As Nellie has already completed the MSCE examination, these benefits are for those students who are yet to receive their results please.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 2:47 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: No please and you may proceed.
27/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/12/23, 2:49 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Let's proceed please.
27/12/23, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/12/23, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Thank you very much for your responses, and your time as well looking forward to hearing from you soon.
27/12/23, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @265881351489, Have a good day ahead!
30/12/23, 5:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Nellie ,

30/12/23, 5:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you all a Happy New Year. May it be filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 11:54 AM - +265 992 38 02 17: This message was deleted
6/1/24, 12:12 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Thank you so much!
6/1/24, 12:12 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Alright
6/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 12:21 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Looking forward to our discussion
6/1/24, 12:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 12:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 12:35 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: 1. Per annum fee after scholarship is 0%.
2. Accomodation fee is 0%.
3. Annual fee $1250
4. Sports and misc fee $125.
5. Admission and processing $575
6/1/24, 12:37 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Admission and processing fee is 1000$
6/1/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265993652542 Please recheck the last point, it's $1000
6/1/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 12:40 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes it is
6/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 12:57 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Loud and clear
6/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
6/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 1:05 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Have gone through it
6/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1250, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
6/1/24, 1:18 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes it is clear
6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/1/24, 2:38 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes
6/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
6/1/24, 7:30 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Very clear
6/1/24, 8:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265993652542 Are you available for the further discussion ?
6/1/24, 8:58 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes I am
6/1/24, 9:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 19th, 2024*.
6/1/24, 9:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
7/1/24, 7:06 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Please do
7/1/24, 10:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, As today is the weekend we were not able to connect with you. Let's reconnect on Monday at 4:00pm.
8/1/24, 6:44 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Alright
8/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nellie , Wishing you a good day! 

In regards to our previous conversation, I would like to know if you are ready for our today's discussion so that we can discuss about your offer letter. I've been looking forward to our today's discussion to plan the next steps in your admission process. Could you please share your response with us ?
9/1/24, 7:10 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Good morning Ms.Ashi
9/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @265993652542
9/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: How are you doing today ?
9/1/24, 9:11 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Am fine thanks how are you
9/1/24, 9:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing fine, I am doing well dear thank you
9/1/24, 9:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if we can start our discussion ?
9/1/24, 9:13 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Am glad you are doing ok as well
9/1/24, 9:13 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes we can
9/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let's start our discussion -
9/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
9/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
9/1/24, 9:17 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Of course we are

But what if one can't manage to pay in that time?
9/1/24, 9:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your query dear, Although I would like to know why you are asking this question ?
9/1/24, 9:27 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Honestly speaking it's going to be hard for us to raise that amount in the states days
9/1/24, 9:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern dear, May I know what is challenge due to which you find it hard to raise the money?
9/1/24, 9:42 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Sorry! ma but I will let my father address this issue later in the day 

This is so because he has the answers and he will come in later because he got banned from whatsapp so we trying every way possible to get him back online/whatsapp
9/1/24, 9:44 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I will be looking forward to connect with him.
9/1/24, 9:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
9/1/24, 9:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
9/1/24, 9:46 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Thank you
9/1/24, 9:47 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: It's Malawi not Zimbabwe

Residing in Lilongwe area 21(chilinde)
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
9/1/24, 9:50 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: We are in malawi ma'am
9/1/24, 9:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, In that case the payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
9/1/24, 9:52 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: The bank
9/1/24, 9:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @265993652542. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you?
9/1/24, 9:58 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: For now I dont

9/1/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @265993652542 Have you gone through the insights ?
9/1/24, 10:12 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes
9/1/24, 10:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I will be looking forward to connect with your father today in the evening. For now we conclude our conversation, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
9/1/24, 10:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
9/1/24, 10:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Thursday at 4:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:17 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes this is ok

But i remember some of the discussions I have had with the team it was mentioned that you will give us a list of universities...I wanna know about that
9/1/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, You are absolutely right that you will receive the multiple offer letters and then you can choose the university of your choice. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
9/1/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
9/1/24, 10:22 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Now it's clear

Thank you
9/1/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
9/1/24, 10:26 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Am not aware <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:26 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 10:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
9/1/24, 10:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
9/1/24, 10:29 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes I do
9/1/24, 10:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Is there anything you would like to ask ?
9/1/24, 10:31 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: No
9/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, On that note, we will be bringing our conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
9/1/24, 10:34 AM - +265 993 65 25 42: Thank you so much

You too have a blessed day
9/1/24, 10:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear!
9/1/24, 12:46 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Good afternoon miss Ashi,and a happy new year to you,my apologies for being quite for so long this was due to a technical hiccup on my gadget.
But I would like to thank your team for the offer to my daughter to this MVN university and the scholarship and all the well articulated packages, school fees 0,accommodation 0 as well this is great indeed and once again thank you.
But having followed the other paying packages we still feel to it that it's still not affordable to us as a family and we have agreed to turn down  this offer due to our financial limitations at the moment,I cannot manage reaching this far.
I hope I have made myself clear and I once again extend my heartfelt appreciation for the effort made so far and we really appreciate as a family for such a kind gesture and may you equally continue to do it yes to those in similar need and may the good Lord richly bless you.
Good day.
9/1/24, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @265881351489, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for letting me know your thoughts here, I would like to have a discussion based on the same. May I know if you are available for the discussion please ?
9/1/24, 12:49 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Yes please and let's engage.
9/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, As you shared that you are not comfortable with the fees structure and cost of education. May I kindly know what are your expectations please ?
9/1/24, 12:59 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Honestly I had very wrong expectations,I thought once done with the edoofa fees then that's it into scholarship then thereafter will be raising funds for the Visa and transportation and not expecting registration to be so huge the amount more than the edoofa payment fees.
9/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that you had other expectations. However, I am not resonating with you as the registration amount was shared with you earlier by your counselor and by me as well. May I know if you remember the same ?
9/1/24, 1:03 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Was the amount mentioned?.
9/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, Please go through these messages we have mentioned the amount with you here.
9/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you see that you have been given 100% scholarship by MVN University. If you remember that the cost of education mentioned to you was $1600 - $2300, this states that the minimum amount would be $1600 annually. But the scholarship has lowered the annual cost to only $1250, right ?
9/1/24, 1:10 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Then my apologies for not taking that into consideration prior into the journey.
9/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't be apologize, I can understand your thoughts here. May I please know if you have understand the role of scholarship here ?
9/1/24, 1:13 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Yes please.
9/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now may I know if there is any concern?
9/1/24, 1:17 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Not really but just to let you know that we will not manage.
9/1/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I can see that you have a concern here but I am not understanding the challenge. I want to help you here, hence It's important for me to understand the challenge, could you please let me know the same ?
9/1/24, 1:20 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: My financial muscle is below reach to the current offer on registration.
9/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate that you have shared your challenge with honesty. If my understanding is correct, you have challenge with registration fees, right ?
9/1/24, 1:23 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: In relation to my income status as of now yes I cannot afford this.
9/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @265881351489, as you have a challenge I am more than willing to help you here. Firstly, I want to know if you have concern related to university tuition fees or university registration fees ?
9/1/24, 1:29 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: The registration and other related cost because I understand that the scholarship has zero on tuition and accommodation as well.
9/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that you have financial concern here which makes the situation tough at the moment. For the clear understanding, May I kindly know how much amount have you been able to raise for the registration process or How much you think you can share by the due date of 19th January ?
9/1/24, 1:36 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Honestly madam Ashi my finances are not up to date and it will be very difficult for me to mention as to how much has been raised so far, imagine I haven't yet recovered from the edoofa fees which I already paid and amidst some challenges here in malawi, honestly I cannot comprehend my apologies once more.
9/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: While I understand the situation that you financial concern here, I want to highlight that this is a great opportunity for Nellie to secure her scholarship seat at MVN University. Being your admission officer, I don't want her to miss out this opportunity that's why I am here to make sure that we can work on the current challenge so that Nellie can secure her scholarship seat at MVN University.
9/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I also understand that you may not be able to anticipate the amount you can raise by the due date, which can be uncertain. However, I want to assure you that I am here to help you find a solution. Although, You need to understand that I can only help you here when I have the right information so that we can provide you the possible solution, right ?

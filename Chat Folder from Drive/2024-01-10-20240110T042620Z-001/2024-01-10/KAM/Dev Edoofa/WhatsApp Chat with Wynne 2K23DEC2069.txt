2/1/24, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing, Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay sir  . I am ready sir
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am done sir. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 401 8032: They are very clear sir . Thank you for the explanation
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am following sir. This is understandable
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 401 8032: This is pretty clear sir. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay sir . We can start
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
2/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes I am ready sir
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

3/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 2) To be an aerospace engineer, one need to have a combination of technical, analytical, and creative skills. Some of the most important skills for aerospace engineering include

- **Mathematics**: One need to have mathematics skills to perform calculations and apply formulas related to aircraft and spacecraft design, performance, and structures. You also need to be familiar with advanced topics such as calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and statistics.
- **Physics**:One need to have an amazing understanding of physics to analyze the forces, motions, and energies involved in aerospace engineering. You also need to know the principles of aerodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and mechanics.
- **Engineering**: One need to have the ability to engineer or design aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, or other aerospace products and systems. One also need to be able to use engineering tools and software to create models, simulations, and analyses of your designs.
- **Problem-solving**: One need to have the ability to problem-solve and troubleshoot engineering issues that may arise during the design, development, testing, or operation of aerospace products and systems. You also need to be able to find innovative solutions to complex challenges.
- **Creativity**: One need to have the ability to think creatively and innovatively to design and develop new and improved aerospace products and systems. One also need to be able to adapt to changing requirements and technologies in the field.

These are some of the main skills for aerospace engineering, but there are also other skills that may be useful, such as communication, teamwork, project management, and safety.
3/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 3) Aerodynamics is an important concept in the aerospace engineering field. Aerospace engineers use principles of aerodynamics to design aircraft, spacecraft, and other vehicles that can travel through the air or space. They use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to model the airflow around the vehicle and optimize its shape to reduce drag (opposing forces which delay ), increase lift, and improve performance . The aerodynamic performance, such as the lift and drag, of a body is governed by the flow of air across its surface. Applied aerodynamics seeks to understand and utilize the fundamental aspects of this fluid flow in the analysis, design, and integration of aerodynamic geometries . Engineers utilize aerodynamic principles to enhance fuel efficiency, improve stability, and minimize drag .
3/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 4)  Lift augmentation devices are components or mechanisms that increase the amount of lift produced by the wing at low speeds, such as during takeoff(leaving) and landing. They can be classified into two main types: trailing-edge devices and leading-edge devices.

Trailing-edge devices are located on the rear part of the wing and they change the shape and area of the wing when deployed. The most common trailing-edge device is the flap, which can be lowered to increase the camber and chord of the wing, resulting in more lift and drag. There are different types of flaps, such as plainand Fowler flaps, each with different advantages and disadvantages.

Leading-edge devices are located on the front part of the wing and they modify the airflow over the wing when extended. The most common leading-edge device is the slat, which is a small movable surface that creates a gap between itself and the wing, allowing more air to flow over the upper surface of the wing and delaying the stall. Slats can be fixed or retractable, and they can also be combined with flaps to create a powerful high-lift system. Another leading-edge device is the slot, which is a fixed gap that also improves the airflow over the wing and increases the stall angle.

These are some of the lift augmentation devices used in an aircraft .
3/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 5)Aviation is a broad field that encompasses many diverse topics and activities related to mechanical flight and the aircraft industrialization. Some of the main areas in aviation include

- **Aircraft design and engineering**: This area involves the creation and development of aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, and other flying vehicles and systems. It requires skills in mathematics, physics, engineering, and problem-solving. Some of the subfields in this area are aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, materials, and control systems.

- **Aircraft operation and maintenance**: This area involves the piloting and servicing of aircraft and their components. It requires skills in flight training, navigation, communication, and safety. Some of the subfields in this area are flight instruction, air traffic control, aircraft mechanic, and avionics technician .
- **Aircraft management and organization**: This area involves the planning and coordination of aviation activities and resources. It requires skills in business, economics, law, and leadership. Some of the subfields in this area are airline management, airport management, aviation consulting, and aviation regulation .

These are some of the main areas in aviation, but there are also other areas that are related to aviation, such as aviation history, aviation research, and aviation journalism.

5/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir we can
5/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 71 401 8032: How are you doing sir
5/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing well. Thank you so much for asking.
5/1/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
5/1/24, 12:41 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh amazing sir
5/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay sir
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Thank you thank you
5/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am ready for the session sir.
5/1/24, 1:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Wynne. There was a technical glitch which led to the delay. I hope you understand.
5/1/24, 1:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: We can now move ahead!
5/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I do understand sir
5/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay sir
5/1/24, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
5/1/24, 1:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh that yes my parents are working on it. They are preparing sir they will definitely do something about it . Thank you for the reminder sir
5/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
5/1/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is  B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh I see sir. Thank you very much
5/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes it is very accurate sir <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
5/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
5/1/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
5/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes sir. I am wondering can you help me please
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
5/1/24, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education
5/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
5/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 401 8032: This is exactly we wish to have sir . This is amazing. I like it sir
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir
5/1/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/1/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
5/1/24, 1:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yaaah I do agree with this sir
5/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
5/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
5/1/24, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
5/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yaaah this is clear sir
5/1/24, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted

5/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: There was a technical glitch which led to this. I hope you understand.
5/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I do understand sir.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit of Edoofa Secure Plan, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
5/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
5/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Exactly that's happening here
5/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes that is it sir
5/1/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir.
5/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 21-January-2024
5/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
5/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Mmm sir you mean $150 right
5/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes why for 10 months
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
5/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I think this is any amazing Idea sir. It sounds great.
5/1/24, 3:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
5/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes you are very correct. What will happen after those 10 months
5/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
5/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
5/1/24, 3:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
5/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yaaah this sounds great sir. It a great plan
5/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Edoofa did very well in planning this I must say
5/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much. We appreciate your compliment.
5/1/24, 3:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
5/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes sir . It is understandable but I have this one question sir
5/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Sir this $150 dollars we will be depositing every month for 10 months is possible to work for it in the EWYL programme or it can only be paid by my parents
5/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Wynne, the Financial Secure Plan is planned with respect to the EWYL program. The basic agenda behind this plan is to prepare you and your parents for the finances of your higher eductaion here in India. Along with the EWYL program, let me explain it to you in a better way:
5/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Oooh okay okay sir thank you thank you
5/1/24, 4:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Consider, your yearly fees for higher education is $3000. Now, EWYL program may help you prepare for the finances of 1 year. But in the long run or over the further years, you may not be able to prepare . That is why, we came up with the Financial Secure Plan. This plan will prepare you better with overall finances of your higher education.
5/1/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope I was able to make you understand!
5/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes now it's clear sir. Thank you thank you for the explanation
5/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 71 401 8032: This message was deleted
5/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 71 401 8032: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is ___Ms Ananya______ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___11 January 2024_____*(mention the date)

As Wynne's parent/ father, l am kindly asking you to have the sessions with Wynne as from 3:30 pm onwards, he will be now at home by this time. All the other times before 3:30pm he will be at school and the school does not allow students to have phones at school.

9/1/24, 10:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Wynne!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day yesterday, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session today at 2:30 pm so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. <This message was edited>

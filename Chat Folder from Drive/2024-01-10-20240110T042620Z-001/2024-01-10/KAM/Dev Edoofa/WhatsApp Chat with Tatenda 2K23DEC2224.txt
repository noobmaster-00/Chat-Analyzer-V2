For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
5/1/24, 12:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk lm done
5/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 12:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
5/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 12:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes lm following
5/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yaaa lm clear
5/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
5/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
5/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir lm ready
5/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

5/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
5/1/24, 12:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Tatenda, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
5/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 704 1765: I'm able to go through starting now

5/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 704 1765: To summarie this whole thing up in the first video l caught that one of the co founders went to Africa and saw people who are open minded and are ready to shoot themselves towards success and that's a good thing to note about my very own Africa. On the other  hand there are people who always blame the situation and don't go towards success.From the story of the 8th grader l learnt to always boost my confidence and aim for higher things in life.On the second video l noticed that due to Edoofas experience which is more than 10 years they are capable of helping you find better employment after tertiary level.I also heard about different types of students from the story of a cup and a tank in the ocean.l was also informed about some of the Edofians like Courage.On video 3 were they explained the step 5.They highlighted about some agencies who do scholarships for money and sent students to poor universities.l was also thrilled from the fact that most of the Edofians pass with flying colours in their tertiary education.The Edoofa community provides students with varies skills that help shape the society.On the last video they talked about the SOP.                

In a nut shell l would like to say that the Edoofa team prepares you physically, mentally and they help you have a better vision..  From these videos l learnt to always listen to the directors
5/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 704 1765: So when will l catch the next discussion
6/1/24, 8:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tatenda!

6/1/24, 8:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: We will have our session today at 12pm.
6/1/24, 8:23 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk sir
6/1/24, 8:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant Tatenda. I appreciate your deep understanding of each of the 4 videos.
We will resume our conversation during our session.
6/1/24, 8:25 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Well noted Sir
6/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Afternoon sir

6/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 704 1765: I'm ready for today's session
6/1/24, 12:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great !
6/1/24, 12:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 12:30 PM.
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
6/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
6/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk sir
6/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Maybe I will be done at  2 pm today
6/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: OKay Tatenda. I have taken a note of this. But our operational hours for today are going to be over at the time. We can reconnect on Monday at 10 am. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Okay sir 🙏
6/1/24, 12:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Have a great day ahead!
6/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 704 1765: .Thank you sir stay blessed 🙏
6/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 704 1765: 2. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.It can only change form or be transferred from one object to another.For example someone eats rice before a race the food consumed is in the form of chemical energy. When the same person runs a race the energy conversion is from chemical to kinetic energy.The second law of thermodynamics states that the state of entropy of the entire universe as an isolated system, will always increase over time.It also says that the changes in the entropy in the universe can never be negative.An example of the second law of thermodynamics is the heat engine model.Heat engines involve a cycle of increasing and decreasing temperature that move a piston. Third law States that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero .An example is steam or vapour of water are the gaseous forms of water at high temperature.
6/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 704 1765: 3. A valve is a device used for controlling the flow of fluids (liquids,gases, slurries) in a pipe or other enclosure.Control is by means of a movable element that opens , shuts or partially obstructs an opening in a passageway.

Butterfly valves are a family of quarter turn rotational motion valves that are used in pipelines to shut off flow. It is often said that butterfly valves can be used to regulate the flow. However ,we do not recommend doing this as it can damage the valve disc and have a negative effect on its properties.We can further elaborate it as a single circular disc which can be manually rotated 90 degrees to start,stop or regulate airflow in a pipe.These valves are commonly used to handle the large ,low pressure flows of gas in a blower system. Butterfly valves are used in pipelines to shut off flow.They are also used in all types of ships and also in firefighting apparatus.
6/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 704 1765: 4.Heat treatment is a process to control the mechanical properties of engineering materials by heating ,cooling and alloying the metal as per requirement. It deals with change in properties by alloying different elements to the metals at various temperatures.

The purpose of heat treatment is to improve the mechanical properties of a material that include hardness,tensile strength,shock resistance, ductility and resistance to corrosion . It also done to improve the machinability and reduce brittleness. Furthermore it is done for the relief of the internal stresses of metals during hot or cold working.Heat treatment can improve wear resistance by hardening the material like metals including titanium,copper and some alloys can be hardened either on surface or all the way through.
6/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 78 704 1765: 5. A compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. An air compressor is a specific type of a gas compressor.Compressors are similar to pumps both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport  fluid through a pipe.  

The types of compressors are...
1.Reciprocal compressor
2.Centrifugal compressor
3.Rotary displacement compressor
4.Scroll compressor
5.Screw compressors

The air compressor is used in gas turbines is of rotary type mainly axial flow turbines.It draws air from the atmosphere and compressed to the required pressure.The other one used in a gas turbine is a centrifugal compressor and also a mixed flow compressor

8/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 78 704 1765: I'm ready for today's session
8/1/24, 10:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tatenda!
I hope all of you had a wonderful weekend and are completely ready for this week.
I am delighted to hear that you are enthusiastic to move forward wit your further process.
Let's Start!
8/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk sir
8/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 278 2476: morning
8/1/24, 11:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great! I have taken note of the above answers and screenshot shared and will update it in our records.
8/1/24, 11:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
8/1/24, 11:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
8/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk sir we can move on
8/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 78 704 1765: It's very accurate indeed
8/1/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
8/1/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
8/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes sir
8/1/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that!
8/1/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
8/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Well noted sir
8/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
8/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
8/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
8/1/24, 11:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
8/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 77 278 2476: the program is good because it assists financially to cater for some costs which we can not afford as parents
8/1/24, 11:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
8/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 278 2476: perhaps it allows accessibility to students to enroll with India universities so that they can aquire updated skills and manage to compete in the day to day industrial techniques
8/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes
8/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 278 2476: yes you can go ahead
8/1/24, 11:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad that all of you are excited to know more about this plan.
8/1/24, 11:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
8/1/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1600-$2300, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
8/1/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
8/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes of course
8/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
8/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
8/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
8/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Yuh really a good thing
8/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
8/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
8/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
8/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
8/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes
8/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
8/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes
8/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
8/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes
8/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 
That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
8/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
8/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes
8/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
8/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
8/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
8/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
8/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 78 704 1765: It's a good thing
8/1/24, 12:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
8/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Yes
8/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
8/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
8/1/24, 12:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
8/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk sir
8/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
8/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk
8/1/24, 12:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
8/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 78 704 1765: By tomorrow
8/1/24, 12:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
8/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 78 704 1765: Olk sir stay blessed
9/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 704 1765: Greetings Sir how are you today?
9/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 78 704 1765: I'm ready for today's session
9/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tatenda and Parents!
I hope you are having a wonderful day. I am delighted that you are excited to take forward the sessions. We will have our sessions at 2:30pm.

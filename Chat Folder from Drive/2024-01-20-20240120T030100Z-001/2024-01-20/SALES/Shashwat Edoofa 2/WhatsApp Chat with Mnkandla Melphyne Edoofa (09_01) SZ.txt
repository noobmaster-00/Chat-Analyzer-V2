If given the opportunity to pursue a baking course, there is no doubt that she would not only excel but also emerge as a star in the world of baking.

Also please share pictures of your previous qualifications results for evaluation. Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
17/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 991 8011: Studying abroad came into my mind when I was in  high school.I noticed that here in Zimbabwe you find someone with a degree sitting at home because of lack of employment.Am not saying all but most of them are not employed . I guess that's because of our economic system ( it's very low).Those who studied abroad are doing great in their life.Its very rare to find someone who studied abroad unemployed.The other thing our network system is very low therefore we struggle a lot when it comes to do research and online studies .
 When studying abroad you get to learn different people, different languages, different cultures and norms .
17/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 77 991 8011: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Melphyne! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!

This not only showcases your ability to thrive in diverse environments but also highlights your courage in exploring new opportunities. May I know whether you are mentally and financially ready to commence with your tertiary education, please?

This role presents an opportunity for me to build up my past success, contribute my skills and knowledge and drive even greater results . There are many reasons why I want to be a medical laboratory technician .I have always been interested in the field of science, performing experiments and this career allows me to do that.I do not want to be in a situation where I would be constantly working at a desk.I like work activities that have to do with ideas .

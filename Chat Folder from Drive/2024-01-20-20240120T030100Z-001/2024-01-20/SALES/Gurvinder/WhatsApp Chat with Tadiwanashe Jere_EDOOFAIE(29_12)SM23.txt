29/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr and Mrs Jere,
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
29/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 593 6498: I am a teacher who specialised in mathematics education. My highest qualification is Master of education degree in mathematics. Am currently the Deputy head teacher for leopold takawira high school  in midlands province. Being an educationist i am motivated by seeing my products' success in life and this includes learners who pass through my hands as well as my biological children. Knowing that education can provide a better future for tadiwanashe and him wanting to be part of Indian education motivates me more. Wellknown doctors in the world have trained in India especially cardiologists who wouldn't want to associate themselves with such a country. I do hope that my son will be part of that history in the finance world
29/12/23, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mrs Jere*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Tadiwanashe*, right?
29/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 410 8187: Yes, most definitely sir
29/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 593 6498: Yes though due to current financial situations here in Zimbabwe i am hoping that he will get a full scholarship so that whatever i will be expected to cover i will manage cause his brother will be in his final year at university this coming year.
29/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 593 6498: Thank you so much for your time and effort in ensuring that tadiwanashe gets the best education available
29/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now *Tadiwanashe*, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A-level/Grade-12?

*Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way*
29/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 410 8187: My highest level of education is my A level/Grade 12 studies, personally I am very passionate about business and finance and generally the way money works so I would love to study Banking and Finance (digital). Well my mother is a teacher and my father is currently unemployed as he is doing is post doctoral studies. Their highest levels of education are masters and PhD respectively. My parents are the ones who have been doing everything they can to support my education although it hasn't been an easy journey. For my higher education abroad I am not yet quiet sure who will be supporting me hence my pursuit for scholarships. I have only one sibling two years younger than me be is studying biotechnology. I study at Midlands State University it is situated in the Midlands region of our country. My term fees for grade 12 was $55us 


As a student I was naturally gifted in the creative arts and my greater passes were in subjects like History and English but growing up in the environment I did I soon became interested in the commercials. And shifting my focus to subjects like Accounting, business studies and Math I soon grew a passion for the business sector and finance as a means of lifting myself from my current predicaments and I hope an opportunity at this scholarship will lead to the realization of my dreams as I am a self motivated highly driven individual who will work hard in order to attain my life's goals
29/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
29/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 410 8187: Currently I am at Msu, my time there greatly contributed to my growth when taking into account my days in the grouf ABAFA which is a student association for future bankers and financial analyst ...and my role in that group being an analyst of any financial projects in the association helped me get a more broad and deepened understanding on how money works and the effects of various economic policies on general profits and losses, also on how hostile and risky the business environment can be...the problems I had to deal with also had a significant impact on my psychological demeanor and in turn left me a completely different person in terms of my thought processes, I also acquired critical thinking skills that I would not have acquired had I not attended the institute, and various problem solving skills, my extra curriculum activities were mostly creative arts being music and sometimes I would Indulge myself in basketball for physical fitness reasons
29/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Banking and Finance, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
29/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 410 8187: Well the thing is it come from the richest yet poorest country in Africa and growing up I used to think it was because of causations such as colonial era ..lack of enough education and the failure to implement strategic  initiatives to ensure the proper running of y
 the economy until after studying ministers like Gono in comparison with individuals such as mthuli Ncube I got to a realization that the prosperity if my country lies within the proper running of the financial industry , so I aspired to do finance because one day I want to be the Finance minister that will put in place proper channels for the thriving of our economy through implementation of correct policies to facilitate just that

04/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 71 410 8187: In five years I see myself working as a financial Manager in a telecommunications institute and I'll probably work there for maybe a minimum of 10 years so that I can be able to sustain a living for my family and in terms of my dreams after the 10 years I would have advanced my skill set and gotten myself a master's degree and will be working on my PhD so that I can start achieving my dreams of being a finance minister. I would have gathered all the necessary skills to help me be an effective minister so that I can help my country realize it's potential and after that I will start initiating new effective financial policies and projects within SADC and my country hopefully by the end of 20 years the whole globe

04/01/24, 12:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Tadiwanashe, Earlier you shared with me that you are aware of the fact that the Edoofa Program Recommends India as a higher education destination for higher education, So I am sure your friend Nicassio must have briefed you about the same?

04/01/24, 1:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: “Education is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire.”
– W.B. Yeats
With my years of experience I have come across many students who have a dream of studying abroad but fail to find a reliable source. They often fall for brokers/agents who don't have a distant aim for your future career. It may also be possible that you would have come across any University publicizing for Admissions from the UK, Australia, Poland, or even India. 
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
04/01/24, 1:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hereby request you to go through this detailed article to compare your previous experiences if you had one. You can feel free to share the Name of the University you applied to or the Name of the Organization that offered you admission at any of the Universities.

17/01/24, 8:38 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 250 1078: Hello
17/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
17/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 250 1078: We already answered this
17/01/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Noted, still let me brief you.
17/01/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
17/01/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Tadiwanashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 250 1078: Ok sir
17/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
17/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 250 1078: Ok
17/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: @263782501078 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
17/01/24, 7:38 pm - +263 78 250 1078: Ok
17/01/24, 10:12 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
18/01/24, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
18/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 250 1078: Ok
18/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
18/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

18/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
19/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Your efforts matter, your dreams are worth pursuing, and you have the power to make a positive impact. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
19/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 250 1078: Yes
19/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
19/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 78 250 1078: Ok
19/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 250 1078: Yes I think it will immensely benefit me
19/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263782501078 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 6:59 pm - +263 78 250 1078: Ok

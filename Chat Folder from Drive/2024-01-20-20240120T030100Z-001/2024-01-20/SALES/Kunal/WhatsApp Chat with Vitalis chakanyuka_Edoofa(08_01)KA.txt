Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Ofcourse l am confident

08/01/24, 7:00 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 7:02 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
08/01/24, 7:32 pm - +263 78 553 7399: So this Scholarship offers how many % Scholarship
08/01/24, 7:34 pm - Kunal: Edoofa offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
08/01/24, 7:35 pm - +263 78 553 7399: I think it's too much eish
08/01/24, 7:38 pm - Kunal: I can understand
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 7:38 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

09/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 553 7399: Yaaah l understand but eish l have a very big request
09/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 553 7399: I was saying  that because at first the price might be higher for my parents
09/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 553 7399: Can you tell me how much amount l have to oky so that l know everything in detail
09/01/24, 12:48 pm - Kunal: Good Morning,

*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." - Sam Levenson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Yes l am here
Good morning how are you
09/01/24, 12:54 pm - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
09/01/24, 12:55 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 12:55 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
09/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Yaaaaah l understand
09/01/24, 12:58 pm - Kunal: May I know if you have understood it?
09/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Yes l have
09/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Oky now l have to ask so the tuition fee ,Exam fee and visa are they togetheror
09/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Tuition +accommodation +expenses
 About Visa and Exam fee
09/01/24, 1:08 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
09/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Yeah but you did not tell me about visa is if offered by the scholarship
09/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Or student
09/01/24, 1:16 pm - Kunal: No dear, it is to be borne by the student
09/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Ooooh a student sort visa for himself  right
09/01/24, 1:21 pm - Kunal: Yes Vitalis
Visa fee:-$83 which is mostly a one-time investment.
09/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Understood
09/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 553 7399: But thought the amount is high at first eish it's annual rite means year rite
09/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Is it paid once
09/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Or
09/01/24, 1:34 pm - Kunal: *This cost is paid in two equal installments.Each installment is paid before a semester.There are two semesters in a year*
09/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Ooooh l understand
09/01/24, 1:38 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
09/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 553 7399: So how can a student be under 100% Scholarship
09/01/24, 1:48 pm - Kunal: Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees, The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
09/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Okyvl understand
09/01/24, 3:54 pm - Kunal: Please address this
09/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Yes l read  it n l understand
09/01/24, 3:56 pm - Kunal: After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
09/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Number 3
09/01/24, 4:00 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

09/01/24, 4:01 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
09/01/24, 4:09 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Wow that's an amazing job
09/01/24, 4:09 pm - Kunal: Indeed it is
09/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 553 7399: So these amount they earn monthly
09/01/24, 4:11 pm - Kunal: That is right, Vitalis
09/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Ooh oky oky
09/01/24, 4:22 pm - Kunal: Please address the question as well
09/01/24, 4:30 pm - +263 78 553 7399: My parents will be helping me if tye payment is affordable for me for the scholarship
09/01/24, 4:31 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
09/01/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 553 7399: They are really surprised and they want me to do this aswell
09/01/24, 4:34 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
09/01/24, 4:34 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
09/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Ofcourse that what l want sure
09/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Yaaaah a little
09/01/24, 4:40 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/01/24, 4:40 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 4:48 pm - +263 78 553 7399: So there is nowhere l can get  an application form without paying
09/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: Vitalis, let me help you understand ahead
There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
09/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
09/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
09/01/24, 5:14 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Am understanding bit by bit
09/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Stage 2 yes
09/01/24, 5:25 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
09/01/24, 5:31 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
09/01/24, 5:34 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Sure
09/01/24, 5:34 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
09/01/24, 5:34 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
09/01/24, 7:41 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
09/01/24, 7:41 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

13/01/24, 12:32 pm - Kunal: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 


This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
13/01/24, 12:32 pm - Kunal: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
13/01/24, 12:32 pm - Kunal: Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
13/01/24, 12:46 pm - Kunal: Since you have performed well in the Academics and sessions so far, I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship which would also depend on the evaluation during interviews and of our Admissions Team
13/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 553 7399: Yes that might be better sure try that fo me

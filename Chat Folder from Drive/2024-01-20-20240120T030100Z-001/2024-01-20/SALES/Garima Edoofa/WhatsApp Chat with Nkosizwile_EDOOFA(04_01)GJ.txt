*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

15/01/24, 11:03 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Nkosizwile

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
15/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 680 9123: Yess am willing to face the challenges along the way and am fully committed
15/01/24, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 680 9123: Am looking for better education abroad and also for better salaries...
15/01/24, 11:15 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 680 9123: I will tell them about the benefits of studying abroad and also assist other students like me in getting scholarships so that they can achieve their dreams
15/01/24, 11:59 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Nkosizwile, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
15/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 680 9123: I agree
15/01/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 680 9123: Yess

I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

16/01/24, 9:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this video as it will give you more insights of the program from the students itself.
17/01/24, 8:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263786809123 @263771079491 @263713630213 , Hope you are doing well.

17/01/24, 9:00 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
17/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 680 9123: Yess
17/01/24, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
17/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 680 9123: Yeah they are aware that's why am looking for a scholarship
17/01/24, 11:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you have a better clarity for the same.
17/01/24, 11:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/01/24, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
17/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 680 9123: Okay
17/01/24, 11:38 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
17/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 78 680 9123: It is affordable
17/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 78 680 9123: So l can also earn while l learn
17/01/24, 12:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Nkosizwile, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/01/24, 12:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
17/01/24, 1:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
17/01/24, 8:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?

19/01/24, 8:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263771079491 @263786809123 @263713630213 , Hope you are doing well.
19/01/24, 8:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, As I was facing some urgent health challenges.

I am here to continue with our discussion, shall we start?
19/01/24, 8:49 am - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about The Earn While You Learn Program?
19/01/24, 9:13 am - +263 78 680 9123: Yess
19/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 680 9123: Okay it's fine
19/01/24, 9:28 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/01/24, 9:29 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/01/24, 9:29 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
19/01/24, 9:29 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
19/01/24, 9:29 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 9:29 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
19/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 78 680 9123: Yah l think l will be benefiting
19/01/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 680 9123: That's what l want
19/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 78 680 9123: So after finishing my degree...will you help me find employment overseas
19/01/24, 9:46 am - Garima Edoofa: surely let me help you with your concern here. Yes after completing her studies in India she will be employable globally. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
19/01/24, 9:46 am - Garima Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
19/01/24, 9:46 am - Garima Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.
19/01/24, 9:46 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope this provides the clarity you were seeking. If you are satisfied, shall we continue with our discussion and move forward?
19/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 680 9123: Yes am satisfied let's move forward
19/01/24, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/01/24, 9:49 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
19/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 680 9123: 4
19/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 680 9123: And 3
19/01/24, 9:58 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Nkosizwile, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
19/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 680 9123: Yess
19/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 680 9123: Can we move forward
19/01/24, 10:24 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Nkosizwile, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 680 9123: Okay
19/01/24, 10:27 am - Garima Edoofa: Nkosizwile as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

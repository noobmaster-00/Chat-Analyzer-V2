Hope you are well.

Please excuse me for not being able to take your session yesterday as I was unwell, but I would like to reschedule yesterday's session to today from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, to ensure that you do not miss out on anything.
So are you ready for the session now?🚀
4/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 77 437 5439: I am so sorry to hear that,  l wish you quick  recovery.Thank you for reschedule my session.   I am ready for the session.
4/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 406 6067: Sorry indeed. How are you today. Wishing you a speedy recovery is Prig's mother
4/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you so much for the concern!
4/1/24, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
4/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 77 437 5439: No l do not understand
4/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
4/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
4/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 437 5439: Thank  you  very much l understood.
4/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
4/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 437 5439: Thank  you  very much,  l am really  happy  to meet you Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi.
4/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you!
4/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
4/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  it is very  interesting  and l am really  looking  forward  to it.
4/1/24, 9:35 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

4/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  it is really  wonderful  and greatest  archivement to be mentioned  by the honorable  founder one day.
4/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
4/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 437 5439: Yes,  it sounds really  great.
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
4/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?

6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs,* showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 437 5439: Wow,  what a miss to me.. I hope the next one l will be there too.  I can't  wait  to see their happy  faces alongside yours too.  Wish you the best  then.

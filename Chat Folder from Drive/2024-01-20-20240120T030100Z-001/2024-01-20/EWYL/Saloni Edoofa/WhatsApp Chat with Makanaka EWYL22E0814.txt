Yes we may begin
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Makanaka, we were on the second project - COMMUNITY BUILDING.
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you hear the audio that I shared twice?
16/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 989 7144: Yes I did
16/1/24, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share in-depth understanding of the same with me?
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 989 7144: The audio is talking about Community Building whereby it is being referred to as being a process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. It involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where people feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate and communicate. The goal is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation as well as a sense of responsibility in order to be able to achieve our determined goals. 
One of the aims of this project for students to learn how to liberate social media in order to help African students to join Edoofa and have the same opportunity we had to acquire international education. 
The project also encourages students who have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create something that will have an impact in the life of others. 
To complete this project we are encouraged to reach to African students who just finished their senior year or who are in their senior year in Secondary school and persuade and refer these students to the program and the head of the organization. 
Lastly the audio goes ahead to mention the scholarship credits that each student will earn for completing the project.
16/1/24, 3:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
16/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 989 7144: Thank you Ms Saloni

How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
19/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 989 7144: Happy Friday Ms Saloni
Yes we may begin
19/1/24, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
19/1/24, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *Makanaka/Saloni/19JAN2024*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
19/1/24, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.
19/1/24, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *01:30-02:30 PM*. Unfortunately, due to some family commitments on Monday, I'll be occupied, and our session may not occur. However, I want you to go through everything that we have discussed so far in this time.

Just so you know, there will be no sessions held on Saturday and Sunday, allowing for a well-deserved break.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend ahead filled with joy and relaxation! 🌺

Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Fumani, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 341 0203: My long-term goal is to become a successful lawyer, driven by a passion for justice and advocacy. I aspire to specialize in a field that aligns with my values, such as human rights or environmental law. I envision contributing to positive social change through legal expertise and dedication to ethical principles. To achieve this, I plan to pursue a rigorous legal education, gain practical experience through internships, and build a strong professional network. Ultimately, I aim to make a meaningful impact in the legal realm, using my skills to address complex issues and uphold the principles of fairness and equality.

The Earn While You Learn program will provide financial support crucial to my educational journey. By simultaneously earning and learning, I can alleviate the burden of tuition and gain practical experience in my chosen field. This program ensures a smoother path towards my academic goals, fostering a balanced approach to education and career development.
12/1/24, 2:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to take forward with our discussions🫶🏻

Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

15/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes we may
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing Fumani, I am so feeling happy to hear this🫶🏻
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you very much
15/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 341 0203: I would like to learn more about these two objectives
15/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Noted,thank you very much for the very clear and understandable explanation.
15/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Following
15/1/24, 2:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is completely alright!
15/1/24, 2:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Persistance, one of my students has _earned around 7,000 USD_ and paid his entire tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Fumani?

18/1/24, 2:24 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

How are you doing?

19/1/24, 2:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Fumani- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
19/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 341 0203: The above document is a list of projects and the requirements and skills required to complete the projects.The document also lists the steps and clear instructions on how to complete these projects.

I believe the above document  is also focused on improving one's skills in both physical and digital marketing,confidence and communication skills.The projects listed above require an outspoken and outgoing individual that is willing to put in a large amount of time into completing said projects and earning incentives from the work put in.
19/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 363 4425: Good day

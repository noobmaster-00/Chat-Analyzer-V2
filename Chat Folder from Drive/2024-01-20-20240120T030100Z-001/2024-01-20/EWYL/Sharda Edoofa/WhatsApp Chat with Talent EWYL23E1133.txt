As we embark on our session today, I'd like to share an inspiring quote that resonates deeply with our journey:

*"Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it."*

This profound wisdom reminds us that while we may encounter various challenges, our power lies in how we respond and navigate through them. It's a testament to the resilience within each of us, shaping not just the path we walk but also the person we become.
18/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 610 2677: Morning
18/1/24, 8:58 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words.

18/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 610 2677: Powerful words
18/1/24, 8:58 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.
18/1/24, 8:59 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Talent these are very powerful words.
18/1/24, 8:59 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
18/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 610 2677: Understood

18/1/24, 9:04 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Job*
18/1/24, 9:04 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

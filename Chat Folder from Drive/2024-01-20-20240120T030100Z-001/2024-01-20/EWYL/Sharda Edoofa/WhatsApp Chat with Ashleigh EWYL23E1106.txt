As we embark on our session today, I'd like to share an inspiring quote that resonates deeply with our journey:

*"Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it."*

This profound wisdom reminds us that while we may encounter various challenges, our power lies in how we respond and navigate through them. It's a testament to the resilience within each of us, shaping not just the path we walk but also the person we become.
18/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words.
18/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am unhappy with your absense in today's session.

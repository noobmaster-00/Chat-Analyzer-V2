20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 77 552 5168: Noted sir thank you very much for your time and all the ideas you shared with us I wish you all the best in your new chapter sir God bless you <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Thank you sir
26/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I'm available sir
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear,  As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I have no problem with the process sir
26/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/12/23, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 3:19 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I understand sir
26/12/23, 3:19 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Noted sir
26/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes sir I believe so too
26/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771835308. we kindly request you to share the following documents for your university application preparation:

1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).

26/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Sir my A level results are not yet out
26/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 77 183 5308: And I'd have to ask for the recommendation letter from My former school

26/12/23, 3:59 PM - +263 77 183 5308: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 3:59 PM - +263 77 183 5308: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your documents with me, For A level May I know if you have statement of entry?
26/12/23, 7:57 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes I have one sir
26/12/23, 7:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please share it with us @263771835308
26/12/23, 8:03 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Ok sir
26/12/23, 8:05 PM - +263 77 183 5308: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 8:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document with me, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/12/23, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/12/23, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I have understood sir
26/12/23, 8:14 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I  don't understand option 3 sir
26/12/23, 8:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, I will explain each of them in detail. Shall I proceed?
26/12/23, 8:16 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Proceed sir
26/12/23, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/12/23, 8:22 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Ok sir understood
26/12/23, 8:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/12/23, 8:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/12/23, 8:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes sir
26/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Sir does the amount of fees I pay change during my 4 learning years by any chance?
26/12/23, 8:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No @263771835308, Your cost of education will be fixed through out your academic journey
26/12/23, 8:30 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Ok understood
26/12/23, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650
26/12/23, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes sir understood
26/12/23, 8:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/12/23, 8:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/12/23, 8:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/12/23, 8:38 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Understood sir
26/12/23, 8:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/12/23, 8:42 PM - +263 77 183 5308: More info please
26/12/23, 8:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 8:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 8:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 8:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Understood sir
26/12/23, 8:49 PM - +263 77 183 5308: So my percentage scholarship can be increased in proportion to my performance at A level?
26/12/23, 8:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263771835308
26/12/23, 8:50 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Okay sor
26/12/23, 8:50 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Understood
26/12/23, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/12/23, 8:53 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes sir
26/12/23, 8:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 8:55 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Following
26/12/23, 8:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
26/12/23, 8:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 8:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 8:57 PM - +263 77 183 5308: All clear
26/12/23, 8:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 8:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Following
26/12/23, 9:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 9:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 9:04 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Understood sir
26/12/23, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 9:06 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I do not have queries
26/12/23, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 9:09 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes sir let's do this
26/12/23, 9:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/12/23, 9:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
26/12/23, 9:16 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Okay understood sir
26/12/23, 9:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
26/12/23, 9:27 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Ok sir same to you
30/12/23, 6:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Takunda ,

19/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 183 5308: 1.$1225
2.duration it's 4 years 8 semesters 
3.$200
4.$700
19/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I saw the scholarship I got is 50% ...
19/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Is it possible that since i passed with all As the university would increase my scholarship
19/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, I am really proud of you for your good results. Regarding your query, Let me share that once we submit your results to the university, your application will be re-evaluated. Although, As you have been granted the Endowment Plan benefit, we recommend completing the registration formalities now. If we submit your application for re-evaluation at the moment, you may lose the Endowment Benefits due to the time taken by the university to evaluate your application. Once you will complete the registration process, your application will indeed be re-evaluated as you had extra ordinary results. I hope you have understood ?
19/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 183 5308: So you mean my scholarship percentage might rise while I'm in the course of learning,,and I'd start paying less,?
19/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that the scholarship percentage may increase although you will be informed about the same before university share your Admission Acceptance Letter.
19/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Okay understood
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we move ahead ?
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes mam
19/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
19/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes mam it's clear
19/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU - <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes please
19/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
19/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 183 5308: So that's separate from the tuition..yes?
19/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263771835308
19/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 183 5308: So that is paid when I get there?
19/1/24, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/1/24, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
19/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 183 5308: You said the $1000 covers food ..so are the food stuffs delivered then we cook by ourselves?
19/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes
19/1/24, 4:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771835308 It truly depends on your choice, If you want to cook your food you have the choice to do so and if you want to order your food that is fine as well. Both of these cost are included in $1000 please.
19/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Okay understood
19/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 77 183 5308: How many meals does one eat per day
19/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 77 183 5308: When staying off campus ...are the equipment for cooking and tv and fridges and stuffs and beds already fitted
19/1/24, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @@263771835308 Please don't worry as all the furniture and equipment will be given to you, we will help you in choosing the accommodation before your arrival. Shall we focus on the offer letter ?
19/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes please
19/1/24, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
19/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I understand that
19/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 31st, 2024*. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 77 183 5308: Yes please
19/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 31st, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 31st, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 183 5308: I have understood that
19/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 552 5168: I'm following your discussion with Takunda, my question is are there any chances that Takunda will get a 100% scholarship so that the fees will be reduced?
19/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 552 5168: As I explained in our first days discussion that my source of income are  not reliable I'm afraid Takunda will drop out from school If fees  continue like this unless they drop <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 77 552 5168: At the same time I want him to continue with education

6/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bradley ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 71 532 7755: Compliments of the season everyone. Thank you for sharing with us this good news.
6/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Yes I am very excited
6/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 092 6205: I haven't gone through it yet let me go through it thoroughly now
6/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please do share your response once you have gone through the offer letter.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 092 6205: I have gone through it
6/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
6/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 092 6205: I am looking forward to the discussion
6/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) What's your Miscellaneous and Uniform Fee (applicable for first year only) ?
4) What's your University Related and Examination fee [Per annum] ?
5) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 092 6205: 1. $1000
2. $700 
3. $100
4. $50
5. It's $1000
6/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1000.
						
Along with this, there is a $50 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $50 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1050.
6/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay noted
6/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
6/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If a student wishes to get a more affordable accommodation, they can stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
6/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $600 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1100  + $600 = $1700. I hope you are clear about this?
6/1/24, 3:04 PM - +258 84 052 7943: Good afternoon, is this a one off payment?
6/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @258840527943 You will be given a flexible payment plan for the tuition fees please.
6/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
6/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
6/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Understood
6/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 78 092 6205: This is clear
6/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1700 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1700 - $1000 = $700 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
6/1/24, 3:24 PM - +258 84 052 7943: Exciting news
6/1/24, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 19th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
6/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay understood.
6/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 532 7755: Yes Please do explain.
6/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay this is clear
6/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 71 532 7755: Ok clear
6/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 78 092 6205: No I stay in Gweru
6/1/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay thank you for sending us his number.
6/1/24, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/1/24, 8:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I was waiting for your response, Kindly do let me know when you will be able to reconnect with us so that we can complete our discussion. Looking forward for your response, Have a good night ahead!
6/1/24, 9:46 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay
6/1/24, 9:47 PM - +263 78 092 6205: We will discuss this then tell you which mode of payment we have decided to use
7/1/24, 10:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright Bradley, Please take your time and have a discussion as a family. Although, I want to have a further discussion with you on Monday at 4:00pm
8/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay

15/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bradley, I hope you had a great weekend!

As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the deadline to complete the university registration formalities is near. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $450 by now?
15/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Good afternoon
15/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, Could you please share your response with us for the above message?

15/1/24, 3:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, If you don't mind May I kindly know the amount you have been able to raise by now ?
15/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 71 532 7755: Hello Ashi so far we haven't been able to source anything we were expecting my husband to be paid at work since end of December up to now they haven't yet done so. So it's a bit difficult to say when exactly they will payout coz the money is over... It's difficult to say dates since the date we had passed. We are just hoping for anyday from now ..
15/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 71 532 7755: This is Bradley's Mother's response.  I think it's better for you to know the  truth of the situation as it is on the ground.
15/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 71 532 7755: I think he will respond to this question better when he gets tym later on today. He is currently at work right now...

17/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Okay I'll be waiting to hear from you
18/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 092 6205: Good afternoon. My apologies, I am aware you said we would communicate on Monday but I wanted to know if I should go ahead and pay my registration fee because the due date is tomorrow

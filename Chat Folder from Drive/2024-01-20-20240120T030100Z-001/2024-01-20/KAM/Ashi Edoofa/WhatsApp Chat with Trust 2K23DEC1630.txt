29/12/23, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

29/12/23, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
29/12/23, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

29/12/23, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

29/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes you can continue
29/12/23, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

30/12/23, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to our yesterday's session, I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you yesterday. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.

30/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Thank you Ms Ashi let say it in brief. The videos clearly elaborates all in depth leaving one without any shadow of doubt , on the video they stated that a student should follow instructions and be open minded, second video illustrated that to a successful student they create job opportunities, they show a path to success making vulnerable children achieve their goals and making scholarship affordable, in the third video they stated that it is an English speaking environment, they mentioned accreditations, and the colleges are a resourceful environment lastly the fourth video they mentioned necessities required in a statement of purpose such as strength and weakness of a student, past achievements just to mention a few.
30/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263771955130, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
30/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
30/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
30/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
30/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
30/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
30/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes , well understood
30/12/23, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
30/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes we are Ms Ashi.
30/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday at 2:00 PM.
30/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group.

1/1/24, 11:41 PM - +263 77 195 5130: 2. What is psychology and how is it a science? What purpose does research serve in

psychology? 
Psychology is the study of mind and behavior.Its subject matter includes the behavior of humans and nonhumans both conscious and unconscious phenomena, and mental processes such as thoughts, feelings and motives.Psychology is a science because it considered a science because it uses the scientific method to test hypotheses and gather data about the way people think and behave. Psychology can be divided into different branches, like social psychology, cognitive psychology, and developmental psychology. It's a very broad field that covers a lot of ground, from understanding human emotions to treating mental illness.The purpose research serves in psychology is that it creates evidence based strategies that solves problems and improves life.

3. What do you understand by Id, Ego and Superego? Please explain giving examples
I understand that the term "ID" is short for "identification". In the context of psychology, it refers to the part of the mind that seeks immediate gratification of basic drives and urges. It operates on the pleasure principle, seeking to avoid pain and satisfy basic desires. The "id" is often seen as the opposite of the superego, which represents internalized values and morals. The term "ego" refers to the conscious mind that operates based on the reality principle, as opposed to the "id" which operates based on the pleasure principle. The ego is the mediator between the id and the superego. It helps to find a balance between primitive desires and internalized morals. The ego helps us to function in the real world, making realistic and logical decisions, and regulating our impulses. It's sometimes described as the "executive" part of the mind.The term superego refers to the part of the mind that contains internalized values, morals and ideals. It represents the internalized values of society and one's parents, and acts as a critical voice, judging actions and feelings. The "superego" is often seen as the opposite of the "id", and may be in conflict with the "ego". For example, the superego may judge certain actions as immoral, even if the "id" desires them. The superegob may also cause feelings of guilt or shame.


4. Why do you think there is a stigma about mental health or talking about mental health?
 How do you think you will be able to remove that stigma and make it more
acceptable to society?
I think there are a lot of different reasons why mental health still carries a stigma. Some people may view it as a sign of weakness, or that someone who needs help is crazy or unstable. Mental health is often not given the same priority as physical health, and there is a lack of education and understanding about mental health issues. This can lead to people feeling ashamed or embarrassed to seek help. However, things are slowly changing as people become more aware of the importance of mental health and the need to break down the stigma around it.l think I should encourage people to talk about it more openly and honestly to reduce stigma in mental health. This means breaking down the myths and misconceptions that people have about mental health, and making it clear that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. I can also educate people about the different types of mental health issues, and how they can be treated. Another important step is to make mental health services more accessible and affordable, so that everyone has access to the help they need.

5. There has been an ongoing debate on whether early or late experiences are more
important in determining aspects of later life. What is your opinion? Do early

experiences rule us for life? Justify your answer.
This is still debatable among people in the morden societies. There is evidence to suggest that both early and later experiences can have a significant impact on our lives.To a greater early experiences are more important in determining aspects of later life this include childhood trauma or attachment styles, can have a lasting impact on our mental health and relationships in adulthood. Nevertheless, there is also evidence that later experiences, such as new relationships or environmental factors, can influence our behavior and beliefs. Ultimately, it seems that both early and later experiences can shape who we are, but the extent to which they do so depends on a range of factors.
2/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Trust, Wishing you a good day!

Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (5-Jan-2024).
2/1/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
2/1/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
2/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Good afternoon Ms Ashi, hope you are doing well
2/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, dear. I am doing fine, thank you. May I know if you have taken a note of my messages?
2/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Ok Ms Ashi
2/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we start our today's session?
2/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes l had take note of them and am taking the procedure's
2/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes we can start l am ready
2/1/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263771955130. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Sociology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes that's true.
2/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/1/24, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes l understood
2/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
2/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
2/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
2/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Well explained
2/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263771955130, Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
2/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes we are in the same boat
2/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
2/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
2/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes , l
2/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
2/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
2/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Well explained Ms
2/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Noted
2/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 195 5130: No l don't, it's well explained
2/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
2/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
2/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
2/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 195 5130: I am excited and wholeheartedly support and believe it
2/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see your excitement.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

2/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 195 5130: I do appreciate Ms
2/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

2/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Am through with this Ms
2/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
2/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
2/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
2/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Well understood Ms
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Well understood Ms Ashi.
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 195 5130: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 05 January 2024 at 08:30 to 09:30 Am
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes Ms
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 195 5130: I do appreciate.
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 195 5130: No it's clearly explained Ms
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 195 5130: No, l have masterd all the procedure's and requirements.
2/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?

16/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes Ms, you can dive deep into it.

16/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that you are traveling at the moment. May I kindly know by when you will be able to continue with the discussion ?
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 195 5130: 1 ,1800
2, 3 years
3, 300
4, 750
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses, kindly allow me to correct you here that your per semester tuition fees is $900.. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 195 5130: I will be available on 19 January 2024.
16/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 195 5130: Yes it's clear Ms
16/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/1/24, 10:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Trust, Wishing you a good day!

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some another commitment due to which you have left the session in between. 

Today, I would like to connect with you so that we can share more information about the university and offer letter. May I kindly know if you are available now for the discussion ?

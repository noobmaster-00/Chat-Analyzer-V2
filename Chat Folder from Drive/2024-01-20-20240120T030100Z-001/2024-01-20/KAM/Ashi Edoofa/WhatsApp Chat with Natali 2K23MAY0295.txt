8/1/24, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Why do you need this much time dear ?

15/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 71 847 7256: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us, Before we start our session today, I would like to know if you have received your A Level results. If yes, kindly share them with us.
15/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 71 847 7256: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Congratulations on reaching this significant milestone and receiving your A-level results! This moment marks not just the culmination of your hard work and dedication over the past years, but also the beginning of an exciting new chapter in your life.

Remember, these results are a stepping stone, leading you towards your future aspirations. Whether they have met your expectations or not, each grade is a reflection of the effort you have put in and the challenges you've faced and overcome. It's important to recognize the journey you've been on, the knowledge you've gained, and the person you've become in the process. ⭐
15/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you reflect on these results, think about the opportunities they open up for you. This is a time to celebrate your achievements. We have taken a note of your results and shall update the admissions team about the same.
15/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 71 847 7256: okay,thank you
15/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Biochemistry)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes I'm arriving in August sir
15/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
15/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
15/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
15/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
15/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes I  understand
15/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 847 7256: about the registration fee is it the $350  that was paid or there is another amount to be paid
15/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263718477256 The $350 you have paid is the Edoofa Enrollment fees. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
15/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
15/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
15/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes
15/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
15/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes I understand
15/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 71 847 7256: and I have been told that if I do EWYL program the amount can be reduced to about $1600 correct?
15/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are correct dear, With the help of EWYL program you can indeed reduce your cost of education.
15/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
15/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
15/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 71 847 7256: noted
15/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 71 847 7256: but the $2800 is without the EWYL program right?
15/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, This amount is without EWYL
15/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
15/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
15/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
15/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 71 847 7256: noted
15/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not continuing our discussion, I would like to connect with you tomorrow at 2:00 pm
15/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
15/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 71 847 7256: sure thing
15/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 71 847 7256: thanks and same to you
17/1/24, 8:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natali, Wishing you a good day! 

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday as I have been occupied with board meetings. However. I would like to connect with you today to move ahead with your journey. May I kindly know if you are ready for the discussion dear ?
17/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 71 847 7256: can we start at 12pm?
17/1/24, 10:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Let's connect at 12pm today
17/1/24, 12:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we continue now ?
17/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes
17/1/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
17/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
17/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
17/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 71 847 7256: so the  $750 includes registration fee and visa fee?

19/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263718477256 The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes I'm m excited 🙂
19/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $750. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 71 847 7256: no, tell me
19/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee of $750 in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university [For most of the universities 15 days]. Subsequently, the second part of $375 , accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes I'm following
19/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 847 7256: no queries
19/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 847 7256: yes sir
19/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.

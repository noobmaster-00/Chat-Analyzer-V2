The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday (January 23rd) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
17/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

17/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
17/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tafadzwa 2K23DEC2931)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
17/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tafadzwa EWYL23E1188)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.
17/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
17/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes , all clear
17/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
17/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 78 378 6270: My counseling session with my counselor was actually the best honestly,  he was very much welcoming and l loved every moment we could do sessions. He also was a good listener giving me an ear and making me feel free to express and explain everything that l know about the program l want to study and giving me again more insight concerning the program. Some of the questions he asked made me know more about this certain program (psychology).

The counseling aspect truly impressed me because l got the chance to know better concerning the program l will be  studying. This is rare in other countries e.g Zimbabwe students don't get the opportunity to be given an insight of what they want to study and hence some end up taking program that they will not be able to see/study through because of how hard and lack of Guidance they have on it. Even the interviews it's something that other countries don't do whilst they are enrolling a student at a university except for certain programs , the likes of Law , Medicine just a few
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and feedback. We're thrilled to hear that you appreciate the mission and values of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We are dedicated to making higher education accessible and affordable, and your success and satisfaction are our top priorities.

17/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes, you may
17/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

17/1/24, 6:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/1/24, 6:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

18/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Done with the videos
18/1/24, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
18/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 78 378 6270: As l went through the videos was able to understand that Edoofa as a program has invested time that is over a decade so that they identify good and renowned schools , colleges and universities for students that have passion in expending their knowledge. So the founders encourage students to be able to follow up instructions given to them so that they are qualified and prepared for these prestigious instructions
18/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 378 6270: The vision that Edoofa has is not only to get students but also give them affordable quality education and make the be employable through a program called SEELS that stands for Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to success but also focusing on increasing the Student's capacity for success that is making students more responsible and able to look aft3r themselves
18/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Edoofa also looks/searches for students that are teachable and open-minded  , and these students should be able to follow Edoofa's instructions 

There is also the Statement of Purpose which is an important document. This document is prompted in taking action and being diligent in filling out the form
18/1/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
18/1/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
18/1/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
18/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
18/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
18/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes , l was able to
18/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes , we are
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
18/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

18/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 378 6270: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 378 6270: If l am able to be granted the chance to get a place in a university. 
A university is going to make me have more knowledge about the course that l always dreamt of doing which is Psychology. It has always been one of my goals too so as l further my education through university will be able to be better and well educated in that course and all of my goals start through getting into university and acquiring knowledge about the course deeper. Also through out the journey want to be able to have a huge impact  in the society through I want to be able to finish my education and further it even more until l am a renowned psychologist that has started up organizations for those people in need of  care and time to be listened to especially the issues and problems they can not share with anyone. I want to be able to have campaigns against staying silent when one is mentally depressed. One person's health matters especially emotionally and mentally, people have to know about the dangers of depression and anxiety. After everything else want to have a positive impact in the society.

19/1/24, 6:54 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Good morning everyone , hope l find you well this morning
19/1/24, 8:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263783786270 Wishing you a good day!
19/1/24, 8:21 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Thank you very much and same to you
19/1/24, 8:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Have you completed the above academic questions ?
19/1/24, 8:25 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes l have
19/1/24, 8:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Please share your response with us
19/1/24, 8:27 AM - +263 78 378 6270: On it
19/1/24, 8:30 AM - +263 78 378 6270: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 8:32 AM - +263 78 378 6270: This message was deleted
19/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 378 6270: 2. Psychology is basically the study of the human mind and behaviour. It is a science because it deals with empirical evidence which is the fundamental principle of any science. Science is focused on the natural and physical elements surrounding any given entity. The human mind satisfies both the central concerns and hence qualifies the discipline of psychology as a science. 

Research widens our understanding of how the mind functions and the interrelatedness of concrete and abstract elements in shaping, predicting and understanding of human behaviour.
19/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 78 378 6270: 3. Id- is the division of the psyche (mind) that is completely unconscious. This is where the drives and needs of a person come from , they are driven by instinct and the physic energy comes from there. Freud  assumed the Id's part of the unconscious due to principles of pleasure, satisfaction and gratification.

Example: a toddler that needs a second helping of a dessert and whined until it was given to them.
19/1/24, 8:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us dear, Kindly share remaining ones as well
19/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Ego - Is the self as contrasted by another self. Once the ego has developed, it is responsible for mediating between the unrealistic id and the reality. It uses reality to help the id satisfy  its demands and to obtain what the ego seeks. Much like id , ego seeks out pleasure by reducing tension that has been created and avoids. Some characteristics of ego are:
- works by reason
- no concept of right and wrong
- weak compared to the Id 
Etc

Example: Someone who works out and is very sweaty. They need to change their clothes and went to change in the car. They knew that anyone could see them changing their clothes , so they find another place to do so
19/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 378 6270: On it
19/1/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Superego- It is part of the psyche that is partly conscious. It represents the rules of society , functions to reward and punish through a system of moral attitudes and has a sense of guilt. The developments for the superego happens around ages 3 to 5. It's function is to control impulses of the Id by using the rules of the society, what is forbidden and what is allowed. Some characteristics are:
- strives for perfection 
- incorporates the values and morals of society 
- persuades the ego to use moralistic goals instead of realistic ones etc

Example: A cross country runner during a race , who knew they could cut their time and come in first if they took a short  cut. No one was watching but the runner would feel guilty , so they decided not to take the short cut.
19/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 378 6270: 4. There is a stigma about mental health or talking about mental health because of lack of understanding and fear. Inaccurate or misleading media representations of mental illness contribute to both these factors. A review of studies on stigma shows that while public may accept the medical or genetic nature of mental health disorder and the need for treatment many people still have negative view of those mental illness. 

I think people need to talk openly about their mental health,  social media has become a great space of positivity. Educating yourself and others will also remove that stigma this is by responding to perceptions or negative comments by sharing facts and experiences.
If one becomes conscious of language again ,that person will remind people that words matter. Encouragement of equality between physical and mental illness is going to remove this stigma
 People also need to show compassion for those with mental illness
19/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 378 6270: 5. My opinion in this debate, l do believe and agree that early and late experiences are more important in determining aspects of later life because a person is shaped by what they have experienced and behaves in certain way because of certain things they have experienced.

Yes definitely early experiences have the greatest impact upon the direction of someone's life. One can be abusive , violent, scared of something or towards someone because they have been through a lot
Since society is one of the aspects that hinders one's behavior. Someone can be scared of men due to a scenario  they have faced with men e.g when one experiences gender based violence they can end up being scared of being around men because they fear that they are going to experience the same since they have instilled the saying "all men are the same". Another example  a woman with abusive father will establish relationships in adulthood which resemble the abusive relationship she had with her father. Freud called this "Family Romance" or how primary relationships stay With one throughout their life
19/1/24, 9:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us, I have taken a note of them. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 9:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 378 6270: We are preparing to make the remaining balance  before the 8th of February since it is the due date for the last payment
19/1/24, 9:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/1/24, 9:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Psychology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Noted
19/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes , correct
19/1/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/1/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/1/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes
19/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/1/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes, correct
19/1/24, 10:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
19/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 78 378 6270: They are all in full support of my decision and they just went on researching more and more about Edoofa so that they get better knowledge about the program , also the pdf  about edoofa helped them to discard their distrust towards the program. They definitely feel this is the best opportunity that we all as family were waiting for  so as to make me fulfill and achieve my dreams that l had. The assurance we getting daily and during the interviews and sessions it's making them feel confident enough that everything is going to go as played.
19/1/24, 10:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes , we are
19/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800).
19/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes , l did
19/1/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/1/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates
19/1/24, 11:38 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Following
19/1/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/1/24, 11:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 378 6270: Noted
19/1/24, 11:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783786270 Are we still connected ?
19/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 78 378 6270: Sorry for that, my data had depleted
19/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 78 378 6270: For now l do not have any queries

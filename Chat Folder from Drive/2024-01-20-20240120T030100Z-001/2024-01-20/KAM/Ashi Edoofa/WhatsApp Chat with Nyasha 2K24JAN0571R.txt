18/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes mam
18/1/24, 11:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 11:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
18/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam you can move on

18/1/24, 11:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 11:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 11:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

18/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 115 4509: L had noticed that on the first video they were explaining about the qualities of those who success to be Edoofians how we earned scholarship credits.
On the second video l also understand that they were explaining about the vision l have as a student and the character traits. 
On the third video l also learned that they were sharing the schools, colleges ,universities that they have on their platform and how they move to discovered these schools and also the experience they have with there students .
On the last video is where they talk about SOP
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
18/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
18/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
18/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky thank you
18/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes
18/1/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes can proceed
18/1/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
18/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam lm am sure by 10:00 am tomorrow l will finish all this task
18/1/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>

19/1/24, 11:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 11:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 78 115 4509: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam but according to our agreement ,you told me that the remaining enrollment fee can be payed on my time but before 15 February 2024 so l thought it's too early oky so let me arrange my plans to make that payment
19/1/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry dear, I am not asking you to pay at the moment. I was just asking about your preparations dear
19/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam thank you
19/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes we are in the process ,maybe if things flows as what we want as a family we could made that payment before the end of January
19/1/24, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/1/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Geography)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes mam
19/1/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/1/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Well noted mam
19/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/1/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/1/24, 12:13 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes have discussed about it
19/1/24, 12:14 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Mam when does this is needed to be payed
19/1/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781154509 Let me help you understand that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you make your final decision regarding the university choice then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.
19/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam thank you for your assistance 🙏
19/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes it's now clear mam
19/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
19/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky clear
19/1/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/1/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam but l need to is there another one with less amount of registration fee course to me to be honestly it's too much l thought both registration and arrival it can be around 1500 to 2000
19/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781154509 I understand dear, Although the above shared break up is just an example for your understanding. The actual cost will be shared with you when you will receive the offer letter
19/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, as you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/1/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Sounds good mam thank you
19/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 115 4509: For now everything is clear mam
19/1/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/1/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/1/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/1/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Wau it's wonderful
19/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Name. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Well noted mam
19/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have you gone through this message ?
19/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes mam l am
19/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
19/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes mam l thought it would be better
19/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee of $1000 in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
19/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000.

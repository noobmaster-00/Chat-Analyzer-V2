Thank you
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes I am ready
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
16/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes I have so
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Indeed they are
16/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Following ✍️
16/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Following ✍️
16/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted
16/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Crystal clear

The registration fee is to be paid when
16/1/24, 3:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That will be informed in due time once you receive your offer letter, dear. Once we complete our sessions, and initiate step 4 of the admission cycle i.e., Offer Letter from University/College, you will be informed of the deadline after receiving the offer letter. I hope this clears your query?
16/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed it does
16/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes 
Which is?
16/1/24, 3:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/1/24, 3:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes I am ready

17/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

18/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday that is tomorrow, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
18/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JjGg3BwhTmXD2hrZiy4JBK
18/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Carlos Albert Marima, and my EWYL group name is Carlos EWYL23E1176. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

18/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Okay then
18/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Let me do so
18/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted once again
18/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
18/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 9 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
18/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted
18/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed . I believe to say that I don't know the actual date that we are going to make the payment,but just know before the 9th of February we will be done with it
18/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Thank you for the reminder by the way
18/1/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear. Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
18/1/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Okay then 
For sure
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted
18/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Taking notes
18/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes it is not right
18/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 274 4769: So this comes down to me to decide which university I will attend right?
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
18/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes they have discussed the same with me
18/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 274 4769: So it varies on which university I choose. Based on the range of $500 to $1000.
18/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 274 4769: But not to this much detail
18/1/24, 6:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
18/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 274 4769: You encompassed the registration fee on the $2000 to $3000 fee . So how is the registration fee of $500 to $1000 related to this amount you mentioned
18/1/24, 7:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would love to continue with our session today, my designated working hours concluded a while ago. I will definitely address your concern during our session tomorrow. Hence, I would like to schedule tomorrow's session at 9:00 AM to continue with our discussion. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night! Please convey my warm regards to your family too.
18/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Okay Ms Siddhi have a blessed night as well
19/1/24, 9:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Carlos. How are you all doing today?
19/1/24, 9:50 AM - +263 77 274 4769: Good morning to you too Ms Siddhi
19/1/24, 9:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope you are doing well today.
19/1/24, 10:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you are a bit confused about the fee break up. Allow me to help you understand it better. The annual cost of your education will be ranging from $1600 - $2300. The registration fee of $500 - $1000 is not an additional cost, as it is included in your annual fee. As we move forward in today's session, you will be able to gain more clarity on the same. I hope this was helpful?
19/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed
And yourself?
19/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 77 274 4769: So the $500 to $1000 amount is part of the $1600 to $2300?
19/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking dear.
19/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes dear, that is correct. As we move ahead in today's session, I will help you understand the fee break up in a better way which will help you gain more clarity on the same. I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 77 274 4769: It's a pleasure
19/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 77 274 4769: Okay
I am following
19/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/1/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.* <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed
19/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 77 274 4769: So after I have enrolled with the university. My annual fee would be $1650 each year right?
19/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/1/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This is just an example, dear. Once we conclude the third step of the admission cycle and proceed to the fourth step, which is receiving the offer letter from the university, you will gain a clearer understanding of your fee structure. I hope this clarifies things for you?
19/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed
Thank you for that
19/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. You are most welcome.
19/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
19/1/24, 11:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 11:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 77 274 4769: This is crystal clear
19/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

19/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
19/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

19/1/24, 12:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/1/24, 12:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/1/24, 12:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear? <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes it's fine
We may continue
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
19/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Taking notes
19/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Very much
19/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 274 4769: You can share the news please!!
19/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
19/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
19/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Okay
I understand
19/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Not at all
19/1/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
19/1/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university [For most of the universities 15 days]. Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/1/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

19/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

19/1/24, 4:42 PM - +263 77 274 4769: So far NO
19/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 274 4769: I just hope that I will get the chance to choose from multiple universities
19/1/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am positive that you will be able to achieve that, dear. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Very much
The happiness is much much
19/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

19/1/24, 6:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon once again Carlos. I am reaching out to you once again because I need to take an update on your feedback form and your EWYL form. Could you kindly share images of the same along with your letter of recommendation?

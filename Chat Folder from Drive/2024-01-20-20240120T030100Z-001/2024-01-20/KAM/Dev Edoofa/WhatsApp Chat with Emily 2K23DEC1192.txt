3/1/24, 11:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much! Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 794 4385: I am ready
3/1/24, 11:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 794 4385: I am done
3/1/24, 11:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 11:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes they are
3/1/24, 11:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 11:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes I am
3/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 77 794 4385: It was very clear thank yu
3/1/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes that would be great
3/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes
3/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Fantastic! <This message was edited>

4/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Edoofa wants to  make sure that children who are in outline spaces are able to access a higher education
Inorder for a student to have higher grades they need to be able to follow instructions and work hard by following the structures and platforms created by Edoofa.
Edoofa makes sure that they put their students in schools that are managed by families or groups with right infrastructure and environment to ensure that children work and achieve their best.
The SOP is a chance for the student to convince any admission board or any school why they are worthy of the admission or scholarship.

10/1/24, 8:44 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Understanding of UX or UIand it's usagr in today's digital world : UX or UI is an essential component of any digital product or service. The user interface (UI) is the point of human to computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop. It is also the way which a user interacts with an application or website.
The user experience (UX) is what a user of a particular product experiences when using that product. By investing in UX or UI businesses can create products that are user friendly, engaging, and effective. This can lead to increased user engagement, satisfaction, conversion rates, revenue, brand reputation and customer loyalty.
They have a major impact on whether user experiences on a website are enjoyable and hassle free.
My understanding of the OSI model and it's layers : The Open System Interconnection model is a conceptual model from the International Organization for Standardization that provides a common basis for the coordinationof the standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection. It is a conceptual framework that divudes network communications functions into seven layers. It consists of the 7 layers : Physical, Data link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and the Application layer.
The Application layer, defines how user application interface or access communication services, initiates, or accepts request, provide network applications like data transfer, messaging, opearating and system functions.
Presentation layer, deals with how information is presented for example ASCII, adds formatting or data transformation.
Session layer, creates and terminates sessionsfor exmple login session. It decides on communication method.
Transport layer, allows error correction during transmission, allows data recovery and multiplexing of signals.
Network layer, adds sequencing and addressing information sets logical protocols.
Data link layer, formats data for physical transmission, access to media.
Physical layer, it is responsible for sending data and receiving data across a physical medium.
Programming and programming languages : programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer tasks to perform in order to solve problems. There are three types of programming languages : machine language, assembly language and high level language.
Javascript and Python are tge mostly popular languages in the startup industry, are in high demand. Most startup use Python based backend frameworks such as Django (Python), Flask (Python), and NodeJS (JavaScript). 
The difference between interpretors and compilers is : a compiler translate codes written in a high level language to a low-level language like assembly language, object code and machine code. It converts code ahead of time before the program runs. 
Whilst an interpretors translates the code line by line when the program is running. It directly executes the instruction in a high level language without converting it into machine code
10/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Mr Kumar
11/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Mr Kumar
15/1/24, 10:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Emily!
How are you all doing?
15/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 307 9320: This message was deleted
15/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 307 9320: Fine and how are you
15/1/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing fine as well. Thank you so much for asking.
15/1/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
15/1/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
15/1/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
15/1/24, 10:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 10:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 307 9320: OK ok
15/1/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Are you excited that once Emily will reach India, she will also be attending these kind of conferences?
15/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 307 9320: Off course we wish if that can happen
15/1/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! On that note, shall we start with our session for today?
15/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 307 9320: It's with pleasure, how ever Emily and her mother are currently attending lessons in class
15/1/24, 10:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, Mr.Sengai. May I know if you are available to attend the session today?
15/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes how ever will be traveling so l may delay to respond due to network challenges
15/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Mr. Sengai. Let's start!
15/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: We have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
15/1/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
15/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 307 9320: Off course we are going to pay monthed of January
15/1/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
15/1/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelors in Computer Application and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes it's very correct how ever you gave us an option to change programme if need be as  we were also opting for Computer Science Engineering
15/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand, Mr. Sengai that Emily wanted to pursue Btech in Computer Science but since Emily did not have science in her A level standard, that is why we are not able to provide her with that option. We understand, Emily's interest in Computer Sciences that is why we have recommended her BCA. I hope you understand?
15/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 77 307 9320: It's OK
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
15/1/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
15/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Off course
15/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
15/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
15/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
15/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
15/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
15/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Thanks so much that's what exactly what we are doing like now
15/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 77 307 9320: To make sure everything is in order
15/1/24, 12:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
15/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 77 307 9320: After l have read it l think l have understand it as it is self explanatory
15/1/24, 12:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know. But please let me explain it to you for your better understanding.
15/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 307 9320: It's ok
15/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
15/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
15/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
15/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Will maintain that thanks
15/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
15/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
15/1/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
15/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Thanks
15/1/24, 12:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! May I please know if you are going to be available for further conversation?
15/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 77 307 9320: It's OK like what time
15/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am just asking if you are going to be available for further conversation right now?
15/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes it's OK
15/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.
15/1/24, 12:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 12:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
15/1/24, 12:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
15/1/24, 12:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
15/1/24, 1:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: @263773079320, Please let me know if we can move ahead with our conversation?
15/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 307 9320: No we don't pay the bank we already have Nostrol accounts me and my wife with reputable banks
15/1/24, 1:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263773079320. Thank you for informing me. However, above I have just highlighted some constraints that are faced by the people of Zimbabwe. I hope you understand?
15/1/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we move forward?
15/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes let's proceed
15/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 307 9320: I was having lunch we can proceed
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know!
15/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
15/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes
15/1/24, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 27-January-2024
15/1/24, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
15/1/24, 2:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
15/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 307 9320: My due date isn't monthed january
15/1/24, 2:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I please know at what date is the payment due? As per the Edoofa Acceptance Letter, your due date is mentioned to be 27 January 2024.
15/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes that's monthed of January
15/1/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank for letting me know!
15/1/24, 3:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if we are on the same page with this question?
15/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 307 9320: I beg your paddorn
15/1/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I just want to know if you are wondering why are you supposed to pay $150 for 10 months and not 20 months to cover the expenses of Emily's higher education?
15/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 307 9320: OK l understand
15/1/24, 3:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
15/1/24, 3:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
15/1/24, 3:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
15/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 307 9320: It's OK will discuss it as family and come back to you
15/1/24, 3:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Actually, more things are part of the Financial secure plan that need to be conveyed to you. Shall I move forward?
15/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Ok
15/1/24, 3:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
15/1/24, 9:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Emily and Parents! I hope all of you are doing great. I understand the network challenges that you were facing and to ensure a smooth admission process, we will have our session at 10:00 AM tomorrow to take forward our conversation. I hope by then you will have a good internet connection. We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night.
16/1/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emily!
How are you all doing today?
16/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 794 4385: I doing great thank you for asking
17/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! We are supposed to discuss the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan further. May I know if you are available for a session right now?
17/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Not now if we can discuss around 00830 pm
18/1/24, 4:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Emily and Parents!
I hope you are doing well, we need to further discuss the Edoofa Secure Plan. Are you ready to take forward our conversation right now?
18/1/24, 7:04 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Yes
19/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263773047944! 
I hope you are doing well. Since our operational hours were over when you replied, I am going to schedule our session for  3:30 pm to take forward our conversation regarding the Edoofa Secure Plan. I hope you are going to be present for the session positively. Till then I hope you have a great day ahead!
19/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 77 304 7944: Noted thank you
19/1/24, 3:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773047944 !
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
19/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes ready
19/1/24, 3:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Picking up from our last conversation, you must have understood the plan for the first 10 months of the Edoofa Secure Plan. 

With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
19/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes
19/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Understood
19/1/24, 3:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
19/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 307 9320: OK can't we use our local banks statement like l use CBZ and my wife uses NBS
19/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 307 9320: I think it will be expensive for us to open another bank account than using those that we are using already
19/1/24, 3:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your query, @263773079320! We are just suggesting you can open account in this bank. If yo uar comfortable with your banks, you can surely go ahead with them only. I hope you understand?
19/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes l do
19/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in your   Bank in Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
19/1/24, 3:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
19/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 307 9320: It sounds good but will be comfortable to pay it when it is required because will be assisted by other family members,  so if l start saying can you give me the money like now they won't so we can wait till the time comes and we will work on it.
19/1/24, 4:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263773079320! I understand and it is totally up to you to take up this Plan if you are comfortable without it. It is proposed to make sure that parents are able to prepare their finances accordingly, as every year, we observe that 20-30% of students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program are not able to come to India due to improper preparation of finances. I hope you understand our concern?
19/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 307 9320: Thanks so much for your concern how ever we appreciates but will try to   meet every stage as per request in due course
19/1/24, 5:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! Continuing our conversation now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?

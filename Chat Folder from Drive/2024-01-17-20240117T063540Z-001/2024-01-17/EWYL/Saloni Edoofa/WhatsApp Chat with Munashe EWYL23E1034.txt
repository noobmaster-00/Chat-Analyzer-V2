26/12/23, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Indeed!
26/12/23, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please do the same?
26/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Concerning the document,my understanding is that the EWYL document is a guideline of the EWYL projects.It consists of the basic skills to achieve your career goals and have a secured future.It consists of two projects the corporate alliances and the African Schools Education Reform Mission.The document tells how to handle the projects and it offers guidelines on how to carry them out.Also,it  tells of the credits awarded after completing each stage of each project and how it has an effect on your annual tuition fee.
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have done it well!
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I will do exactly as you said.
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you listen to the audio?
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am done with the process and would like to confirm that I understood the audio profile.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes,Ms.Saloni I did
26/12/23, 3:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

27/12/23, 1:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
27/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 78 307 6096: From the audio profile,I understood that the projects have certain objectives which includes gaining an understanding of the markert you want to enter in the future and begin to plan for it at an early stage.It also gives an opportunity to connect with technology driven and digital companies.This can be obtained by following the task of identifying such companies in your country or regionally by starting to enquire from your immediate network.It also gives an understanding of how the mentor will help you in achieving the project.It also teaches the student to be patient.
27/12/23, 1:51 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Munashe, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Thank you for the compliment Ms.Saloni,it means a lot to me.
27/12/23, 1:54 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes,I read and understood about the projects . I am also ready to start the process and earn credits.
27/12/23, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, Munashe!
27/12/23, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Munashe? I can help you.
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 78 307 6096: For now I can confirm that it is understandable and I am satisfied with the explanations.
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Lovely, then we will move forward!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Munashe, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Munashe!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I listened to the audio profile and understood it.
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
27/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I understood that the second project works towards community building.It teaches Edofians community building by strengthening connections, communication, relationships and sharrling identities with a certain group of people or individuals.The project ,creates an environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging.They can collaborate, communicate and work towards common goals.This project is there to foster  a positive   community that promotes social introduction and participation in a shared responsibility and ownership towards achieving the little success.The primary outcome of the project is for students to gain good networking skills,and how to use social media to offer African students an opportunity to join the Edofians Educational ecosystem and acquire international education that can prepare them for their future.This is obtained from identifying willing youths who are willing to pursue the program and connect them with Edoofa .The Edoofa will also assist the students so that their efforts will not go to waste.The project teaches students to identify opportunities and use them to  change the lives of others.
27/12/23, 2:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
27/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am also looking forward to connecting with you on the scheduled time slot tommorow.Thank you for the day.

28/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright! <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Munashe, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
28/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

28/12/23, 2:06 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I understand Ms.Saloni and we are on the same page,I am following.
28/12/23, 2:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Of course, we will!
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
28/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I get it Ms.Saloni and I am looking forward to make this project fruitful.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Munashe/Saloni/28DEC2023*
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
28/12/23, 2:30 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I understand and I get you clearly Ms .Saloni
28/12/23, 3:05 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
28/12/23, 3:07 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Thank you for today we will surely reconnect tomorrow.
29/12/23, 1:41 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Good afternoon Ms.Saloni.
29/12/23, 1:43 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Munashe,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
29/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am doing fine ma'am how are you?
29/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Of course we can begin.
29/12/23, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Iam doing well, thank you!
29/12/23, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you try forming the group?
29/12/23, 1:55 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms. Saloni and I am still trying to get as many students as I can.
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: What steps did you take yesterday?
29/12/23, 2:02 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yersterday I managed to list some of the students that I felt would be legible for the program.
29/12/23, 2:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I understand that!
29/12/23, 2:07 PM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/12/23, 2:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Thank you Ms Saloni for giving me this information to make the journey more fruitful
29/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I get it
29/12/23, 2:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You are always welcome!
29/12/23, 2:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.

5/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes Ms.Saloni
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please share the same?

5/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
5/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Answering to Question 2, this is the message that I am going to use to reach out to the school head: I am Lo-rraine Munashe Mutema,a former student at this school from the year 2019 to 2022.I am contacting as a proud Edofian  who is  grateful to the Edoofa Scholarship program for taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Here in Zimbabwe, internet costs are steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to join hands with me to create a brighter tunnel for our students after higher education. By any chance if you find this opportunity worth your time as  it was for me and other students,allow me to connect you to the Edoofa community.I an looking forward to a positive engagement.Thank you.

And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

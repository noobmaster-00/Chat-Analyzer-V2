I guess that's all i can say for now in order to spare our time
26/12/23, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Your pencil art skills sound impressive. I'd love to check out some samples whenever you're up for it, even if you're working with limited materials.

AmaPiano dancer? That's pretty awesome! Amapiano is blowing up everywhere, and being into fashion and photography on Instagram adds a cool vibe to the mix.
26/12/23, 1:51 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Let me show you samples of my artwork
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, please!

26/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Bekithemaba! All of these are beautiful! I cannot take my eyes off.
26/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 71 616 0258: 😁
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Explain please
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Understood
26/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Ok sure
26/12/23, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Interesting
26/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
26/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Ok sure
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: For today, we need to wrap up our session, and we'll continue this discussion in our next session, which is tomorrow at 1:30 p.m!
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Ok thank you
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,  Bekithemba! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Good afternoon😅... Well we may start
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - +263 71 616 0258: I've gone through the newsletter
27/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
27/12/23, 2:48 PM - +263 71 616 0258: The achievements made by Nyasha  Manzou was the spot i liked most
27/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Sorry my network is bad due to bad weather this side
27/12/23, 4:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session earlier. However, since our session time is over, we shall connect tomorrow at the same time.
27/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Okay sure
28/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Bekithemba!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀
28/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Good afternoon, thank you so much
28/12/23, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
28/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Sounds great
28/12/23, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
28/12/23, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:40 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Clear
28/12/23, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
28/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 71 616 0258: In this document, There are a variety of options on the EWYL Program, so in this case you choose which you feel suit you best either.... Frm 1 corporate alliance, 2 community building or African schools education reform mission 

Am i correct ryt??
28/12/23, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
28/12/23, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude our session today, reflect on the progress you've made and the insights gained. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our future sessions, feel free to share. Wishing you continued success and looking forward to our next session! 🌟

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days.

11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Okay thank you for sharing😇

11/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Wow, pretty amazing
11/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
11/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
11/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
11/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
11/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
11/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

11/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Remember that your consistency is something that will make you achieve heights! So always attend your session on time, and trust me, no one can stop you from earning credits!

Therefore, good luck, and see you tomorrow!
11/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 616 0258: Okay sure
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Bekithemba!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 616 0258: That's an assumption 😂
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: No! It's the truth!
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

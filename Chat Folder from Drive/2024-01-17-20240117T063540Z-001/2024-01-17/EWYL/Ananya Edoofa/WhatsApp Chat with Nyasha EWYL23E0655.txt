23/12/23, 11:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha!

How are you doing today?
23/12/23, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/12/23, 5:59 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Good Evening maam
26/12/23, 7:49 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Thank you
27/12/23, 7:05 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Good morning ma'am
27/12/23, 7:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nyasha!

How have you been?
27/12/23, 8:07 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Good and you ma'am
27/12/23, 8:08 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Long time
27/12/23, 8:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, tell me how's your work life going?
27/12/23, 8:15 AM - +263 78 019 5828: All is good maam we start at 7 to 5 from Monday to Saturday and it's a day shift . night shift. Runs from 6 to 6
27/12/23, 8:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand Nyasha, do you have any breaks in between?
27/12/23, 8:19 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Yes but they're very short
27/12/23, 8:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Nyasha, let's do this! The main reason we're connected is for the EWYL program, enabling you to earn scholarship credits. Speaking from experience, these credits will be beneficial once you're in India. I've noticed that students with some credits in their accounts lead a smoother life here, as they don't have to pay their complete fees online.

I have two more students who are balancing part-time jobs while simultaneously working on the EWYL project to secure scholarship credits. It's like they are handling two roles. You can continue working on your projects and provide updates whenever you have time. Try connecting with people at your workplace and explore connections with their children.
27/12/23, 8:28 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Yea sure
27/12/23, 8:29 AM - +263 78 019 5828: But I have failed to connect with headmasters
27/12/23, 8:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. Are they not responding?
27/12/23, 8:33 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
27/12/23, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Can you please share a screenshot with me, so that I can help you with the conversation ?
27/12/23, 8:47 AM - +263 78 019 5828: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Nyasha, you know you should never share the whole information at once. Always wait for the reply, discuss your views, and then ask if they want to proceed; they can fill out the form. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Okay and also I'm failing to get phone numbers of different headmasters
27/12/23, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, can I know if you are working on your second project?
27/12/23, 9:02 AM - +263 78 019 5828: I'm working on it
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, do you have a community building group?
27/12/23, 9:06 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Yes ma'am I do have one
27/12/23, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so Nyasha should we set a target for you?

27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so for this week, I want you to connect with 8 students and submit their application forms with me.
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Ok ma'am I will work on it
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great! By the way I assume you already know that every school class has an informal WhatsApp group.

You can request to be added to the group and share information. Additionally, you can share the group's WhatsApp link and invite others who might be interested in joining. You can also add me to the group, and I can assist you in engaging the students.
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - +263 78 019 5828: Okay Ma'am

7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 78 019 5828: Noted
11/1/24, 10:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Nyasha!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 78 019 5828: Good afternoon maam sorry for not connecting with you in the morning
15/1/24, 12:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha!

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
15/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 78 019 5828: Good afternoon màam

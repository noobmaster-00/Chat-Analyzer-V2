20/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
20/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Okay sir
20/12/23, 8:35 PM - +263 71 532 8424: From the first video;
 In short I understood that , Edoofa's message to students is: "Your future, your way." Edoofa believes that students should be able to pursue their educational goals in a way that fits their individual needs and interests. Edoofa offers a wide range of programs and courses, so that students can find the right path for them. They also provide a supportive and flexible learning environment, so students can learn at their own pace. Most importantly, Edoofa is very committed to helping students achieve their goals, whatever they may be which is different from the rest of the crowd.
20/12/23, 8:42 PM - +263 71 532 8424: From the second video;

I understood that Edoofa's vision is to create a world where anyone, anywhere can access quality education, regardless of their socioeconomic background. They believe that everyone deserves access to quality education, and they are dedicated to making this vision a reality. Edoofa's unique approach to education is focused on digital learning, which allows them to reach students all over the world for example Courage from Africa and also Edoofa uses a variety of innovative methods and tools to deliver education in an engaging and effective way.
20/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 71 532 8424: From the third video;

 First, Edoofa has partnership with high-quality schools, colleges, and universities around the world meaning that students can be sure they are getting a quality education when they enroll in a program through Edoofa. Second, Edoofa offers a wide range of programs, from certificate courses to full degrees. This means that students can find the right fit for their needs and interests. Third, Edoofa provides a fully online learning experience, so students can learn from anywhere in the world.
20/12/23, 8:53 PM - +263 71 532 8424: From the fourth video;

I understood that students need to be prepared for the interactive sessions they will have with schools, colleges, and universities including being familiar with the Edoofa platform, being ready to ask questions, and being open to new ideas and perspectives. It is also important to be respectful and professional during these sessions, as they are a chance for students to make a good impression and learn more about the school or program they are interested in. Students should come prepared with any questions or concerns they have about the program, so they can get the most out of the session
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 8:57 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Thank you sir for the session ...enjoy the rest of your day too
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Munashe!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:07 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Good evening sir
21/12/23, 6:07 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes we can proceec
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
21/12/23, 7:09 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes sir
21/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
21/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
21/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

21/12/23, 8:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
21/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Noted sir
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Munashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Good evening sir
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes sir
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: ith this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
27/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction? 

Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
27/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/12/23, 8:42 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes,  it is accurate
27/12/23, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
27/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
27/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes
27/12/23, 8:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
27/12/23, 8:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/12/23, 8:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/12/23, 9:06 PM - +263 77 841 0069: Thanks so much
27/12/23, 9:07 PM - +263 77 841 0069: Can you explain more especially in figures about the secure plan
27/12/23, 9:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/12/23, 9:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/12/23, 9:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/12/23, 9:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/12/23, 9:12 PM - +263 77 841 0069: Same as you noted with thanks sir
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - +263 71 532 8424: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:37 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Good evening sir
28/12/23, 6:37 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes we can proceed
28/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your University Enrollment Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you accordingly.
28/12/23, 8:03 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Thank you sir
28/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. In the meantime shall we proceed our session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 8:05 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes sir
28/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
28/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
28/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
28/12/23, 8:23 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes sir
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
28/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes
28/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 29, 2023.
28/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
28/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
28/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 71 532 8424: We have paid up
28/12/23, 8:37 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes
28/12/23, 9:02 PM - +263 77 841 0069: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:03 PM - +263 77 841 0069: That's the 150 balance paid today sir
28/12/23, 9:11 PM - +263 77 841 0069: Noted but on the other hand we are also running our small family business so we want to maximise on those small profits to keep our  working capital growing
For example we make a sale of 500 dollars say our profit is 120.
We need that 120 to buy raw materials for our production. By repeating this we gradually grow our stocks thereby increasing our working capital and life goes on
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/12/23, 6:05 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Good evening sir
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:25 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes sir
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your Enrollment Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you accordingly.
29/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Noted sir
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, may I know by when you might be able to start with the same?
29/12/23, 8:13 PM - +263 77 841 0069: I might pay it once when it will be the right time. We are also trying to establish other income avenues for example grocery and hardware shop from the profits targeting may 2024
29/12/23, 9:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your update and your consideration regarding the enrollment fee. We understand the importance of timing and your efforts in establishing additional income avenues.
29/12/23, 9:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:29 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Thank you Sir
30/12/23, 6:50 AM - +263 77 841 0069: Thanks so much
Also as a family we wish you healthy happy and a prosperous 2024 and longlife
2/1/24, 6:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 6:38 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes sir 
Good evening
2/1/24, 7:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
2/1/24, 7:08 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Why
2/1/24, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/1/24, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
2/1/24, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/1/24, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Does Edoofa offer flight tickets
2/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Can the $1500 be paid once off when if is needed
2/1/24, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The edoofa secure plan is mandatory for all the students and no, edoofa does not offer flight tickets
2/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Noted sir
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
2/1/24, 9:55 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Have a great night too
3/1/24, 6:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 6:06 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Good evening ...yes
3/1/24, 7:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
3/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yeah
3/1/24, 7:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
3/1/24, 7:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
3/1/24, 7:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
3/1/24, 7:31 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Noted sir
3/1/24, 7:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
3/1/24, 7:38 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Yes
3/1/24, 8:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
3/1/24, 8:05 PM - +263 71 532 8424: By tomorrow
3/1/24, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
3/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 71 532 8424: Good night sir

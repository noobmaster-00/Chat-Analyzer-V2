21/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/12/23, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
21/12/23, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
21/12/23, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
21/12/23, 2:26 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Clear
21/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
21/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
21/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
21/12/23, 2:30 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I am following
21/12/23, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
21/12/23, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/12/23, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
21/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
21/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yeah I get it
21/12/23, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
21/12/23, 2:35 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
21/12/23, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/12/23, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

21/12/23, 3:43 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The Edoofa program is there to assist tertiary education to be affordable.
21/12/23, 3:43 PM - +263 78 038 1173: They also need a student to be well behaved

21/12/23, 3:45 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The Edoofa program will also help me to reach my destination
21/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263780381173, Is there anything else you would like to add?
21/12/23, 4:09 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
21/12/23, 4:09 PM - +263 78 038 1173: They will assist you till you are employable
21/12/23, 4:16 PM - +263 78 038 1173: In addition to that the Edoofa program may also provide adequate information on each and every programme that a student want to do
21/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear,  Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
21/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
21/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
21/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
21/12/23, 4:21 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I agree the information is correct
21/12/23, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263780381173, I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time. 

Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
21/12/23, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
21/12/23, 4:29 PM - +263 78 038 1173: From 5:00 PM to 8:30
21/12/23, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 5:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
21/12/23, 4:42 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you. You too there I wish you a good day
21/12/23, 4:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263780381173,
25/12/23, 10:04 PM - +263 78 038 1173: How does business contribute to economic growth
26/12/23, 7:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Munyaradzi, I hope you are doing well.
26/12/23, 7:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have any question which you would like to ask?
26/12/23, 7:45 AM - +263 78 038 1173: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 7:59 AM - +263 78 038 1173: 2. Explain about Business process management

Business process management is the practice of modeling, analysing and optimising end to end business process to help meet your strategic business goals such as the improvement of your customer experience framework.
In addition to that, business process management is the discipline in which people use various methods to discover, model, analyse, measure, improve, optimise and automate business processes. Any combination of methods used to manage a company's business process is business process management.
Furthermore, business process management strategy involves defining, designing, executing, monitoring and optimising business process to increase efficiency, effectiveness and agility.
Added to that, business process management helps the organisation to reduce wastage and achieve sustainable goals. A typical example is that a retail business can automate and streamline its inventory management system by using sensors to detect inventory levels and update database in real-time

26/12/23, 8:02 AM - +263 78 038 1173: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 8:13 AM - +263 78 038 1173: 3. How does business contribute to economic development?

An increase in capital goods, labour force, technology, human capital can all contribute to economic growth. Economic growth is commonly measured in terms of the increase in aggregated market value of additional goods and services produced using estimates such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Furthermore, a business may contribute to economic development through organic growth. Organic growth refers to a situation whereby businesses expand internally rather than taking over or merging with other businesses. Organic growth can exist through a number of different ways such as increased output, expanding into international markets and launching new products.
In addition to that, independent businesses provide their local economies with new jobs, products, revenue and services.
Added to that, the introduction of new technologies may lead to efficiency in an organisation. Efficiency may influence the country's production possibility curve to shift outwards hence economic growth. On the other hand, the businesses may discover new raw materials and this may also lead to economic development
26/12/23, 8:38 AM - +263 78 038 1173: 5. What is the importance of human resources in an organisation?

A key role of human resources is talent recruitment, training and retention. The human resources team can help an organisation to fill a crucial role with the right person. They can spend the time to craft the right incentive and benefits packages to make the company appealing and competitive.
In addition to that, the human resources are most important services of any organisation since they are the catalyst of non-human resources and the medium for developing competitive advantages and sounds of creativity. No organisation can exist without a human resources department.
Added to that, by leveraging the full potential of the human resources function, organisations can attract and retain top talent, build a positive workplace culture, manage and mitigate risk, drive business strategy and improve organisational performance.
Lastly, human resources are an organisation's most important resource because they control all other company resources. That is the reason why it is so vital to have appropriate human resources in place at all time
26/12/23, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munyaradzi, I hope you are doing well.
26/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 78 038 1173: I'm good
26/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the academic questions. May I know if you have completed the SOP form?
26/12/23, 2:22 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Let me try again my network was poor
26/12/23, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263780381173
26/12/23, 7:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263780381173 I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (29-Dec-2023).
26/12/23, 7:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

27/12/23, 11:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Munyaradzi, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 11:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With respect to your admission journey, May I know if you are available for the session?
27/12/23, 12:11 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi! 

I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
27/12/23, 12:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
27/12/23, 12:14 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you Ms Ashi
27/12/23, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, May I know if we can start our discussion today?
27/12/23, 12:15 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yeah we can start
27/12/23, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263780381173 . Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BBA* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/12/23, 12:31 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes that is correct
27/12/23, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/12/23, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/12/23, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/12/23, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/12/23, 12:34 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/12/23, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/12/23, 12:39 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I am aware of that
27/12/23, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/12/23, 12:44 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes we are on the same page
27/12/23, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
27/12/23, 12:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
27/12/23, 12:50 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yeah I have taken note
27/12/23, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
27/12/23, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/12/23, 12:52 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok it's fine then
27/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/12/23, 12:54 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok I get it
27/12/23, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 12:57 PM - +263 78 038 1173: I would like to ask that what would be the estimated cost for my scholarship journey till the end of the first semester
27/12/23, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me dear, I would like to share that the estimated cost for your total cost of education will be in the range of $1200 to $1800 per year. I hope you understand?
27/12/23, 1:00 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yeah so how about the payment dates
27/12/23, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263780381173 I will assist you about the payment dates soon in our session, Shall we proceed ahead?
27/12/23, 1:03 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes we may proceed
27/12/23, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/12/23, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/12/23, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 1:06 PM - +263 78 038 1173: That is great news though
27/12/23, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263780381173 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/12/23, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
27/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.

27/12/23, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Clear
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/12/23, 1:55 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Further information needed
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Noted
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
27/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 78 038 1173: I agree
27/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 78 038 1173: We will be having our first session on 29th December 2023 and I'm thrilled to see your enthusiasm. To continue our journey, I'd like to offer you a choice between two-time slots. Please select one that works for you:

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
Monday to Friday, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM
Let me know which one suits your schedule best.
27/12/23, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Clear
27/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
27/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Noted
27/12/23, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
27/12/23, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

27/12/23, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Clear
27/12/23, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment.

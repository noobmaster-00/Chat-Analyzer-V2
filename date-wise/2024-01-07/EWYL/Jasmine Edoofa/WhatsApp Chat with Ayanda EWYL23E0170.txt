26/12/23, 1:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good afternoon, Ayanda,_*👋🏼
Before delving into your Christmas celebrations, I'd like to bring your attention to the session timings. 
Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session?
26/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok mam . But why did we change from the morning session to the afternoon session
26/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I don't mind doing the afternoon session but why did we change <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 1:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: My dear, initially, I could only allocate one hour in the morning. However, due to the considerable lag compared to other students, I sensed the necessity of prolonging the session to 2 hours. This adjustment aims to ensure that we cover more ground during our sessions.
26/12/23, 1:37 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Okay i get it
26/12/23, 1:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So before we start, I couldn't stop myself but ask, how was your Christmas? 🌲

26/12/23, 1:46 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: You know this year, I spent a quiet and reflective time with my family, cherishing the festive spirit.

26/12/23, 2:54 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
26/12/23, 2:54 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Yes i do
26/12/23, 2:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
26/12/23, 2:58 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I did and am still waiting for his response
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok mam
26/12/23, 3:01 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok
26/12/23, 3:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
26/12/23, 3:55 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I will be asking the head???
26/12/23, 9:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I will let you know on how to do this
26/12/23, 9:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. 

*Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*
I want you to inculcate the habit of joining the session on your own and just give a quick "I'm here" when you're online at 1:30 pm. 
Can I expect this from you?
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Yes mam
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.

28/12/23, 1:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Ayanda, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
28/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I don't understand what you are trying to say
28/12/23, 1:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you remember this message?
28/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Yes i do
28/12/23, 1:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, This is what I meant to say, that make sure to edit this message and not copy paste
28/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok
28/12/23, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.
28/12/23, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.
28/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I did and he hasn't responded that when is he available
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I did that in july and am still try to connect with him but no response
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So I would suggest you to look for more schools
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok mam
28/12/23, 2:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok i understand
28/12/23, 2:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
28/12/23, 2:06 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok mam that's amazing
28/12/23, 2:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(Ph.D.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
28/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 77 466 4432: That is also amazing mam
28/12/23, 2:13 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ohh why
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Isn't scholarship a 50/50 thing
28/12/23, 2:19 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Can you please elaborate?

28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: What, Ayanda?

28/12/23, 3:01 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Ok
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - +263 77 466 4432: I am a proud edoofian

I hope you are doing well.

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you in our next session*
Have a great evening!
3/1/24, 6:32 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Same to you mam
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 466 4432: Applications???

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

The founder should have strong background interms of experience and qualifications  and past accomplishments
I should also consider searching recent funded start-ups ,study the company a little more, study it's website, checking it's social media pages and background of people associated with the company
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: You know what Melody, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

3/1/24, 1:47 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That's a heartwarming question your pet might pose! If they could talk, they might express their curiosity about the depth of care and attention they receive.
3/1/24, 1:47 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 3

3/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 428 8199: Yeah

3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
3/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 428 8199: I totally agree Ms Jasmine
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 428 8199: I am following Ms Jasmine
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
3/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 428 8199: I am so thankful and ready Ms Jasmine please
3/1/24, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?

3/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 428 8199: I will tailor and modify it Ms Jasmine

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

2/1/24, 2:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Promise, I am impressed with your understanding.
2/1/24, 2:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
2/1/24, 2:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
5/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 963 8583: A1. St Anthony's High School. Yes the school is connected
A2.Good day to you Sir/Madame l Tagarira Promise a former student wishes to share my Experience with Edoofa
A3. Masvingo
5/1/24, 2:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
5/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 963 8583: Yes l do agree
5/1/24, 2:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
5/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 963 8583: So l should start right now ?
5/1/24, 2:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
5/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 963 8583: Yeas ma'am l am ready
5/1/24, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

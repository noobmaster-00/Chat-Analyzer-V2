26/12/23, 8:37 AM - +263 77 801 0698: Good morning
26/12/23, 8:37 AM - +263 77 801 0698: I'm ready

26/12/23, 8:41 AM - +263 77 801 0698: Yes everything is clear
26/12/23, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/12/23, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
26/12/23, 8:44 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
27/12/23, 8:42 AM - +263 77 801 0698: Okay noted
27/12/23, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
27/12/23, 8:43 AM - +263 77 801 0698: Oky noted
27/12/23, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
27/12/23, 8:47 AM - +263 77 801 0698: You briefly said when the per term fees is less than 100 
Then we won't consider the students for the scholarship if they're unable pay 2000 for their higher education right. Can u please explain more on this highlighted area
27/12/23, 8:50 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure so the explanation for this is that when the per-term fees of a school are less than $100, Edoofa's Program Director does not conduct a school call. This decision is based on the consideration that if a student's family can afford only a minimal amount for school fees, it is doubtful whether they would be able to manage the higher expense of around $2000 for higher education.

In essence, the decision seems to be a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on schools where there might be a higher likelihood of students being able to afford the costs associated with Edoofa's higher education programs. It reflects a consideration of financial feasibility for the students and their families.
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 77 801 0698: Okay thank you for the explanation
27/12/23, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!

27/12/23, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
27/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 77 801 0698: Yes I am
27/12/23, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!

We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
27/12/23, 9:24 AM - +263 77 801 0698: Thank you thank you
27/12/23, 9:24 AM - +263 77 801 0698: I'm done
27/12/23, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/12/23, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 12:00-1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
27/12/23, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
27/12/23, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Kuvimbanashe, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
28/12/23, 12:05 PM - +263 77 801 0698: *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'*
29/12/23, 3:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Also, I want to ensure that you do not miss out on anything so I would like to reschedule our session on Wednesday from 10:30 to 11:30 AM. Make sure you are on time for your session, okay?

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

Hope you are well!

Keep it up, Kuvimbabnashe!🚀
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @263778010698 

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

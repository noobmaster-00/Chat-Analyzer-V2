29/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 78 791 3093: I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a change in my plans regarding the offer I received as Tanatswa Kaniwa. Recently, I was fortunate enough to be awarded a scholarship by the Zimbabwe government, which I have decided to accept. As a result, I will not be taking up the offer previously extended to me.

In light of this development, I kindly request guidance on the process for obtaining a refund of the enrolment fee that I had paid. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in facilitating this process.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and am grateful for the opportunity you offered.
2/1/24, 2:37 PM - +27 62 556 9098: Good afternoon
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!
Hope you are well.

First of all, it's great that you got a scholarship from the government but as you know you also have a Scholarship Abroad i.e. in India. I always thought it was your dream to come to India to study, I hope you make your decision regarding your career wisely and choose the best for you in every possible way especially keeping in mind the Employability part as well and regarding your refund I am not the best person to talk to, you shall reach out to the admissions team and I think you should think again before taking such a big step, as being in India is a big opportunity in itself, emphasising on the quality, affordable and employable education.
2/1/24, 2:53 PM - +27 62 556 9098: Thank you so much ,so may you give me the contacts for admission  please
2/1/24, 2:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You can contact them in the Admissions group.

2/1/24, 3:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome, also I would like to mention that I am a female.

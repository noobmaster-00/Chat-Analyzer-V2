2/1/24, 3:10 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
2/1/24, 3:10 PM - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

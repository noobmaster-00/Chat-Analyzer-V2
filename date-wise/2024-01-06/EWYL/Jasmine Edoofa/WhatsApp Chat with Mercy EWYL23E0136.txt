Are you ready for the session?
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 915 3722: Yes
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 915 3722: Im doing good
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So last time we were discussing Project 2
Do you remember?

2/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 915 3722: Noted
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Mercy
2/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 915 3722: The goal is to create a WhatsApp group so that l can reach out a large number of students who can join Edoofa Program. I can reach them though speaking with the school headmasters
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Mercy, I am impressed with your understanding.
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
